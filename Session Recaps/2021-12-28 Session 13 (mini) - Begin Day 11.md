# Session 13 (mini) – 28th December 2021
## Vallaki - Day 11 since Arrival in Barovia

With Sasha leading the way, we reach the Church and are faced with a troll and three vampire spawns. Urwin and Prince Rupert are already there fighting them, and just as we arrive Urwin falls unconscious by the hands of one of the vampire spawns. Sasha runs towards the front of the Church, ushering people inside.

Varian charges, wanting to get the attention of the vampire slashing at Urwin, but misses his attack. Unable to carry Urwin back to safety, Varian disengages and runs back to his companions.
Jeremiah, seizing his opportunity to inflict maximum damage to our enemies, casts fireball, engulfing all three vampire spawns, the troll and Prince Rupert in deadly flames! 
The troll advances and slams his chain in a powerful line in front of him, knocking Magda prone and badly hurting her and Jeremiah.
Magda’s Spirit Guardians are still up, a cloud of bats surrounding us, continuing to cause riot and damaging our enemies. She stands up, reading herself to help her companions and stabilizes Urwin.
Arlo jumps straight into the thick of it, wielding Wife Hunt fiercely and protecting Urwin’s fallen figure.
Jeremiah finishes off one of the vampire spawns, blasting a ray of sickness at him and stealing his life force for himself, then runs behind a tombstone for cover.
Varian runs towards Prince Rupert, helping him kill another spawn, and disengages back to safety.
The troll swings again, this time in a sweeping arch all around him, finishing off one of the vampire spawns.
Seeing Arlo badly hurt, Magda runs towards him and cures his wounds. Arlo, feeling some strength return, madly hacks at the troll’s ankles, forcing him down. With a last blast of force, Arlo drives Wife Hunt into the troll’s head, killing him!
With only one enemy left, Varian runs in, leaps forward and digs his dagger into the vampire spawn's back, killing him. 

No more enemies immediately pressuring them, the party runs inside the church with Prince Rupert carrying Urwin. As we get in, Sasha slams the door behind us, securing it with a wooden beam. Inside, we see all the windows boarded up but can still hear the clamouring of the vampires outside. Prince Rupert, Urwin and Sasha run down to the catacombs, while Father Lucian kneels in front of the altar with the bones of St. Andreal softly glowing, prying. Blinky stands close to him, holding some kind of device.

As we stand there, the vampire spawns encircle the Church’s grounds, not quite coming forward at first, but suddenly rushing in with gurgling and piercing screams of pain as they start disintegrating by approaching the holy ground. Sasha, hearing this, ushes the last people downstairs and closes the door. The party stands with Father Lucian and Blinksy.
Blinksy tries to set of his traps, set all around the church, but the rush of vampire spawn’s has the wire torn and now he can’t pull the triggering pin out. We can see the little device 60 feet away, a throng of vampire spawns in the way. Jeremiah, eager to help, casts catapult, making the pin fly and setting the trap off. The party runs towards the altar, having 12 seconds to find cover.
Finally, the explosives go off, causing the windows to burst in, sending splinters and broken glass flying everywhere. With a ringing in her ears, Magda quickly gets up, tending to the wounded. She stabilizes Father Lucian and bring Jeremiah back to consciousness. 

Suddenly there’s a different chill in the air. As mists tumble in through the broken windows, we see bats flying in, turning into the form of a man no other than Strahd von Zarovich!

He glides towards Arlo, introducing himself and kissing his hand. He seems to be assumed, wanting to rewards us for our efforts. Seeing Father Lucian unconscious by the altar, he heals him. He admires Father Lucian’s devotion to the Morning Lord, even though he claims to have killed him centuries ago, ripping his heart out of his chest. As he talks, he hovers his hand over the bones of St. Andreal, slowing destroying them into dust.
He sets the dust on fire and in the flames we see Lady Fiona Watcher in her study, surrounded by the vampire spawns, holding an amulet with the notable Watcher family Eye on it. She looks scared, a blue light glowing around her. But lamps flicker and shadows creep from the corners of the room, eventually involving her completely. The flames on the altar flare up, replacing the image by Lady Watcher’s body, trembling and at death’s door.
We hear screams of terror and pain from downstairs and people banging on the door, but Strahd is keeping it tightly shut. He tells us that, regrettably, with the bones of St. Andreal gone, our dear friend Sasha has gone into quite a frenzy. But we have an option. He looks at Magdalena and tells her that, if she feeds on Fiona Watcher’s blood, he will assuage Sasha’s thirst. With this proposition, he leaves. 

**The party ends with Magda on 29 HP, Jeremiah on 6 HP, Arlo on 5 HP, and Varian on 11 HP).**

# Session 13 Post-Credits Sequence - 3rd January 2022
## Vallaki - Day 11 since Arrival in Barovia

Magda hovers over the Lady Watcher’s body. “What do I do?” she asks the party. “I know what I want to do, what my blood is screaming for constantly, but I’ve learned to ignore it. So what’s the right thing to do? And why would he do this?”

___

Jeremiah's pacing the room, lost in thought, when Arlo speaks first, he mutters, annoyed, "Drink Lady Watcher's blood, obviously..." then goes back to deep thought and pacing, increasingly panicked.

___

Arlo:  “I’m not sure what kinda effects this bloodlust thing has on you, Magda, but what I do know is that I’d much rather Lady Watcher's neck be on the line than those poor buggers down there. I think it would be wise to play Mr Strahd's game for a while, until we’re ready to pay him back his dues."

___

Magda:  “We are rats on his operating table.” She rattles her fingers off the desk. “Normally my impulse right about now is to flip the table over completely. As it is, I don’t even know what that would look like… Why do I get the feeling this is the bait… and there’s a hook coming?”

___

Varian:  “Exactly my thoughts. If Strahd has this kind of power over Sasha, what’s to say he won’t have it over you once you drink Lady Watcher’s blood? Is this a risk we can take? But those are innocent people dying downstairs. Is Lady Watcher’s life worth more than theirs?”

___

Magda:  “I don’t see why he couldn’t just do that to me now though. Strahd is stronger than any vampire I’ve met and I’m barely subsisting on chickens… we couldn’t take her at our current skill level. It would folly to try…” She thinks about it. “Would it?”

___

Varian:  “Take Sasha out?” He looks at the party, noticing everyone’s wounds, “I don’t think we could.”

___

Magda looks around the room, at each of them in turn. “This is such a bad idea….” But she gets up.

She leans over the Lady Watcher’s body, and whispers something in her ear.

”I have not drank human blood in over half a century. I have tried to be good. But for you, you wicked hag, I will make an exception.”

It is quick, and gory, and visceral. Bits of throat splatter across the table, arterial spray in a fountain, then down to a splutter. Magda stands, eyes like pinpricks, drenched in red.

She wipes her lips with the back of her hand, and then slurps the wipings. “How… quickly I forget,” she says to herself. She’s laughing. Breathless. She just stands in a moment in it, closing her eyes. The Lady Watcher crumbles into dust on the table. 

Magda opens her eyes. She’s looking at the party now. Like she’s still lost in the sauce. 

Like she’s still hungry.

___

Arlo removes a handkerchief from his sleeve, and holds it out to Magda. “Red is your colour, my dear."

Magda twitches, looks at the handkerchief, and grabs Arlo by the wrist. But it’s like when you have too much sugar at once and your muscles suddenly go weak, and it gives her a second to think. Her eyes return to normal. “Arlo.”

She rips the handkerchief out of his hand. “That was very misguided of you.”

# Update from @TenderstDM

For a moment the church falls still, and then the catacomb’s door creaks open. At first a few townsfolk emerge, exhausted from their attempts to break the lock, and then the rest come. Battered and wounded, slowly they trickle out, a seemingly unending sea of broken faces. Father Lucian begins to guide people out into the street, cautiously at first, but it appears the city is quiet, apart from the sound of rain.

As the crowd thins, a bat escapes, flapping madly before taking off through a shattered window. And then the final figures emerge - and the dice are rolled.

Dargos Weerdo limps past, he manages to catch your eye and asks you to come see him before leaving town.

Alek is the last of the guards to come up, helping carry the wounded, “five dead he says… well, five in the catacombs, many more in the streets.”

Prince Rupert follows behind, cradling the body of Urwin Martikov. 
“One moment she was crying with her head in her hands, the next she came at us hungry and snarling. Father Lucian was a fool to take Sasha in, all vampires belong to their master… Urwin was barely back on his feet before he gave the last of his life, protecting the townsfolk down there”. 
The Dragonborn cannot cry, but the pain is clear in Prince Rupert’s eyes.

Nobody seems keen to stay inside for long, and soon you are alone in the broken hall. A faint blue glow emanates from an amulet in the ash where Fiona’s body lay, the same you saw her clutching before she was overcome by shadows.

Blinksy remains at the door, staring out. The church grounds are a mess of rubble and embers, no trace of the vampire spawn remains. In the dim light of the afternoon, the Eye of the Watcher manor gazes down over the town. Able townsfolk and the remaining guards tend to the wounded and start clearing the streets.

In the direction of the Baron’s home, wisps of smoke can be seen in the distance.

___

**With the 'Battle of Burning Sun' concluded, the party continues in downtime with Magda on 29 HP, Jeremiah on 6 HP, Arlo on 5 HP, and Varian on 11 HP.**
