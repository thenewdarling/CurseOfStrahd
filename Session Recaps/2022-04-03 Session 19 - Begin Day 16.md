# Session 19 -- 3rd April 2022
## Day 16 - Arabelle's house, on the Outskirts of Krezk

During downtime, Arabelle has a vision of the Tower falling, of Danton unconscious, possibly dead.

The session opens with Magda casting Sending to send a message to try and confirm their survival. After receiving a reply, confirming the events of Arabelle's vision happened, the party set out on the two day journey to the Winery.

On our first watch, Jeremiah receives a visit from the shadowy horseman who hovered around the party when they first entered Barovia. He gifts Jeremiah a bow blessed with Halfling's Luck.

## Day 17 since the party arrived in Barovia

We pass whole fields of wilting flowers, and reach a fork in the road. South leads to Yester Hill, and to our right are the vineyards.

We press on, and it seems like the Winery is being guarded by ravens, and a wolf. Shapeshifters, among them Danika Martikov. They are [[the Keepers of the Feather]]: Adrianna, Benjy, Davian and Elver. Adrianna is a werewolf, and the others transform into ravens. Davian is Urwin's older brother, and Benjy and Elver are partners, with Elver expecting a child. We learn that Urwin was also one of their number, and it's likely he was the one who gave Jeremiah his coin, and led us from Mother Mog's grasp.

The kids don't know Urwin is dead yet.

Varian shows them a book he has, which he has been keeping in secret. It is magical in nature, and seems to fill with his thoughts and dreams each night. We find out it once belonged to Tasha.

Varian and Magda have a heart-to-heart about the book, after which Varian helps Magda find a wild animal, since this is the last day before the last of Lady Watcher's blood is spent.

There is an... altercation with the horses in the stable yard. Magda probably should've asked permission. It's fine. I won't go into detail. It's fine. Everything is fine.

Meanwhile, [[Freek and Myrtle]] are told Urwin has died, and Adrianna recounts a story to them -- the Spirit of the Wild Rose. Through the story, we find out about Eliza Day, who haunts the rose garden on Yester Hill. The person who killed her was buried alive by the Village People. (Before or after recording YMCA, we are not sure...) 

She is why the vineyards hadn't been rotting despite the lack of sunlight in Barovia. But something has happened recently to the tree where the man was buried -- it's split down the middle. We put the pieces together that he is the man who stole the sword from Yalom.

Adrianna is perplexed by Magda's decision to feast on the horse in the barn but tells her not to bother telling the others, and that she would deal with it later. Magda gets a bucket and a mop to clean the aftermath up.

(Magda's timer resets at this point, and will expire on Day 24.)

There is a funeral service for Urwin.

We find out the Morninglord and the Night Mother looked over Barovia until the mists came. The Night Mother appears to be gone. ([[The Keepers of the Feather]] are followers of hers.) They think the Morninglord is also gone, but don't have the power to challenge the Church in Krezk. They try and warn people from Berez, and think the witches are likely the ones who broke the tree. (They guess.)

Arabelle's brother went to Berez in the hope they would help him. The witches have links to Mother Night, and are the ones who Gertruda went looking for all the way back in Barovia Town. 

Varian gives the Rose ring to Adrianna, as Rose wishes to stay with the other children, and away from the danger for now.

## Morning of Day 18 since the party arrived in Barovia

With heavy hearts but full bellies, the party make for Yester Hill.

**The party ends the session with Magda on 52 HP, Jeremiah on 26 HP, Arlo on 65 HP, and Varian on 28 HP.**
