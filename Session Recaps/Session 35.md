# Session 35 â€“ 26 January 2023

## *Session beginning Day 30*

The session opens with [[Danika]] Martikov replying to Magda's *Sending* spell. She believes that the [[Witches of Berez]] will kill her on sight, and therefore she won't be able to come and get the ring. She also says that [[Ireena]] has been taken to [[Castle Ravenloft]].

[[Arabelle]] has a tearful reunion with [[Bromley]].

[[Neander]] appears to have some kind of illness? There is a brief discussion as they believe themselves to be property, [[Arlo]] thinks possibly closer to a pet.

[[Magda]] enters the [[The Sleeping Sparrow]] and talks to its bartender, [[Cordelia]]. Two tieflings watch her in the corner that she remembers from around the skirmish with [[Rahadin]] -- she assumes they are assigned to watch her, so she approaches them. 

Their names are [[Fang]] and [[Naesala]]. It turns out they know [[Magda]] from her history in [[Iliadvar]] -- [[Aleksandr]] is still alive, and lives a ways away near [[Lake Zarovich]]. Their friend is [[Flynn]], his son -- who died in the battle with [[Rahadin]]. They ask why she hasn't aged, and she lies that she came here not directly from the [[Prime Material Plane]], but through the Plane of Fire -- and so for her, the passage of time has been even stranger.

Meanwhile, [[Bromley]] tells [[Arabelle]] that [[Baba Lysaga]] has darkness in her past and that it still hurts her, but she looks after these people. He thinks [[Strahd]] destroyed [[Mordesh]]'s mind. [[Arabelle]] corrects him, that she was being controlled by [[Baba Lysaga]], and that when the curse was lifted she was left a husk. He is unconvinced.

[[Arlo]] and [[Neander]] meet [[Nessa]] at her apothecary. [[Nessa]] talks to [[Neander]] about spirit, she thinks the 'sickness' is likely to be an emotional pain. She also gives [[Arlo]] *Everfrost berries*, which offer cold immunity - (I believe as a gift for [[Arabelle]] to warm her up to her? This is from memory.)

[[Arabelle]] mentions to [[Bromley]] during their debate on living forever in [[Berez]] that she met [[Strahd]], that she had a plan to trick him, and that it involved getting the [[Skull of Argynvost]], and that was why she was here.

There is also mention of a sinister-sounding 'initiation ceremony'...

**The party end the session during their long rest.**
