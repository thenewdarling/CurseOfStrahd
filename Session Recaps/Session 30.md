# Session 30 – 16 Oct 2022 (part 1)

## *Session beginning Day 26*

- Within the Hall of Bones, [[Strahd]] throws a cloth over an object on the table. The light which blinded [[Magda]] to the the room and its contents fades.
- [[Arabelle]] attempts to touch the object, and has a vision of a feathered face, partly humanoid. She is forced back.
- [[Jeremiah]] attempts to cast *Identify*, and with a nat 20 to maintain grip on the object -- he identifies it as the [[Holy Symbol of Ravenkind]].
- Arabelle covers the symbol and takes it.
- Strahd wants us to go to [[Berez]], to retrieve the [[Skull of Argynvost]] from the [[Witches of Berez]]. "The skull is mine by right. I defeated [[Argynvost]] long ago." 
	- When asked what he needs it for, he says, "Pride? Glory? Decide for yourself."
- Strahd leaves, telling us there are beds available.
- Arabelle gives [[Cyrus]] another mushroom.
- Jeremiah attacks Cyrus unprompted with *Catapult*.
- The bones in the room come to life, and [[Arlo]] stops Cyrus attacking Jeremiah.
- Cyrus leads us to a wing of the house with a shared hallway and bedrooms off to one side.
- Jeremiah tries to pick the lock.
- Arabelle finds a harp under the bed, which Jeremiah confirms is just a regular harp (as far as magical aura is concerned).
- Arabelle hands the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind to Arlo, saying "I'll be right back," and casts *Gaseous Form* on herself to sneak through the door.
	- Arlo: "Every woman in my life is a fucking genius."
- Arabelle meets the creepy doll, [[Pidlwick]] II.
- Gargoyle eyes glow and activate some kind of anti-magic effect, dispelling *Gaseous Form*.
- [[Rahadin]] catches Arabelle, stabs her hand. She casts *Banishment*, but he casts *Counterspell*, and sends her back to her room.
- Pidlwick blowdarts Arabelle with some kind of poison, causing her to pass out.
	- Arlo takes her in and lays her in one of the beds. The party try to get a sleep in, while Jeremiah keeps watch.
- In the middle of the night, Arlo hears foreboding warning whispers from the Symbol.
- Jeremiah, on watch duty, approaches a window, hearing something, before mist begins to crawl through the window....
- The mist forms into [[Sasha]], who attacks!

*Cliffhanger.*

# Session 30 – 17 Oct 2022 (part 2)

- The party fight with [[Sasha]].
- Jeremiah almost drops, falling unconscious and being saved by his *Mirror Image*, while Arlo uses the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind to repel Sasha (The light keeps Magda out of the room, unable to cast healing magic without a line of sight.)
- Arlo drops the Symbol to allow Magda into the room, who casts *Spare the Dying* before dealing the finishing blow to Sasha. 
- Sasha clutches at Magda as she dies, "You can't... let him... leave..."
	- Magda picks up Sasha's holy symbol of Asmodeus out of her ashes, considers it for a moment as she brushes it off... and throws it out the window where it disappears into the mists.

## Day 27 - [[Wiki/Places of Interest/Castle Ravenloft]]

- The party are awoken by Rahadin, who informs them he has a vial of Arabelle's blood, and will be able to track them as he does the rest of the party.
- Strahd's plan is for Rahadin to use the carriage to drop the party, [[Viktor]] and [[Stella]] off at [[Vallaki]], where he will lead the party on foot to [[Berez]].
- Arriving in Vallaki, the party bid a short farewell to the children, before beginning the journey to Berez.
	- Magda casts *Find Familiar* on the first night.
	- Rahadin casts some kind of magic during the night, but Jeremiah can't work out what it is from sight.

## Day 28 - on the path to [[Berez]]

- They pass the fork in the road to [[Argynvost]] but Rahadin doesn't allow them to stop.
- Jeremiah's Ranger training tells him someone is following behind them.
- Arabelle casts *Speak with Animals* and asks a squirrel to go and find out what is happening.
- Rahadin finally works out someone is following them. "Show yourself."
- A man tells everyone to drop their weapons. We do. Rahadin doesn't.
- The man drops some kind of magical darkness on the surroundings, and we see a glint of [[Ireena]], who appears with a gleaming sword and tells us to run!
- We run, but Jeremiah stops to try and cut Rahadin's bag (in order to retrieve the vial of blood). As a result he's too slow to keep up with the others. There is some kind of oak tree with a portal in it that Ireena rushes us all into.
- Jeremiah overtakes Rahadin, and almost gets into the portal, before Rahadin critical hits him with a rope arrow and pulls him back.
- Ireena whispers to Jeremiah, "I'm sorry", and closes the portal on him, blocking both him and Rahadin off from the rest of the party.

**The party ends the session with [[Magda]] on 31 HP, [[Jeremiah]] on 7 HP, [[Arlo]] on 31 HP, [[Arabelle]] on 21 HP, and [[Neander]] on full health. (May be off as we took many short rests.)**
