# Session 43 â€“ 12 June 2024

## *Session beginning the morning of Day 39* - [[Mount Ghakis]], at the mouth of the [[Amber Temple]]

- [[Ireena]] and [[Davian]] are not entering due to their lack of attunement to [[Strahd's diary]]. ([[Ireena]] is not sure if she doesn't need it, but isn't taking chances.)
- We find [[Van Richten]] at the door, where [[Baba Lysaga]] has put some kind of slug down his throat. We learn that she was created by [[Strahd]], he gave her the power she has. This is her prize for releasing [[Ezmerelda]] into the [[Prime Material Plane]].
- [[Van Richten]] came for [[Tasha]], who is in the [[Amber Temple]].

**Lore**: The [[Amber Temple]] predates [[Barovia]]. This valley used to be the nexus of lots of different planes. Monks in the Valley settled upon it, discovered the amber rock, and built the temple to trap wandering spirits.

- We enter the temple, and find the Temple Guardian, and its Faceless Monks, wraiths who stand guard.
- We have an altercation trying to get some potions from the ghostly Potion Master. [[Arabelle]] casts *Speak with Animals* and makes friends with a [[Treasure Rat]], who she calls Ryan.
- We find a robe on a Wizard corpse, which has a *Glyph of Warding* on it.
- There is a pit puzzle.
	- *"Arlo is enraged. 'This pit has made fools of us, Neander.'"*
- We find the Spilled Ewer. Infinite wine, I believe? Sounds like any given Saturday am I right? ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰

*The session ends still on Day 39.*
