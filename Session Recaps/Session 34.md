# Session 34 â€“ 5 January 2023

## *Session beginning Day 29*

- [[Arlo]] finishes his attunement to [[Strahd's diary]], seeing visions of [[Strahd]] in the wars that led to [[Barovia]]. being trapped in the mists.
- Coming to, he sees [[Van Richten]] talking to a raven, who leaves. He says that [[Rahadin]] is coming, and [[Arlo]] has to choose whether to come with him and meet the rest of the party later, or stay. [[Arlo]] chooses to stay.
- [[Van Richten]] taps a ring on the wall and the bricks rearrange to form a portal to a mountainside far away. (See: [[Ring of Portal]].) He gives the ring to [[Arlo]] and says to give it to [[Ireena]] -- that she would know what to do with it.


- Back in the Tomb of [[Argynvost]], [[Magda]] and [[Ireena]] run ahead and in the confusion, [[Arabelle]] and [[Neander]] are able to stay behind in order to sneak the Skull of [[Kala]] into the [[Coin of Portable Hole]], using a quick *Feather Fall* to keep it from being damaged when it hits the ground. 
- [[Neander]] jumps in the coin themselves so [[Arabelle]] can use *Gaseous Form* to allow them both through the wall of fire.

- Confronting [[Rahadin]], he pulls out a spine, and at the end of it is [[Jeremiah]]'s head.
- [[Rahadin]] defeats us soundly, and drags us to [[Berez]].

## Day 30 - [[Berez]]

- We awake, tied to a tree outside of [[Berez]], barely alive. Notably, [[Ireena]] is missing.
- We are freed by the [[Witches of Berez]], and meet [[Nessa]], [[Beatrix]], [[Gertruda]], learning about [[Baba Lysaga]].
- We are invited to find rest in [[The Sleeping Sparrow]] inn.
- [[Arabelle]] is given directions to her brother [[Bromlin]]'s house.
- Magda casts *Sending* as they now have a day for the *Spell-Refuelling Ring* to recharge. She relays a message to [[Danika]] Martikov:

*Danika, it's Magda. We're in [[Berez]], [[Rahadin]] got us. [[Van Richten]] said [[Ireena]] needed this ring, but we've been separated. We could use some help.*

**With that, the party ends the session with low HP but beginning a downtime day in [[Berez]] where they will gain the benefits of a long rest.**
