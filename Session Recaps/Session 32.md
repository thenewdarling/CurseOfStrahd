# Session 32 â€“ 1 December 2022

## *Session beginning Day 29*

- Between sessions, [[Jerry]] replies to [[Magda]]'s message: *Near [[Berez]]. Five miles north of the road. I am followed. Not much chance of survival. Will move towards [[Vallaki]] soon as possible.* He is alive. For now.
- [[Arabelle]] asks [[Arlo]] if [[Ireena]] can carry the [[Holy Symbol of Ravenkind]].
- The party formally agree to refer to the golem as [[Neander]].
- Outside the keep, there is a statue of [[Saint Markovia]], sporting a similarity to the [[Holy Symbol of Ravenkind]].
- [[Neander]] approaches the gate, opening the door a crack and seeing a spectral knight sharpening his sword on a whetstone.
- The knight seems to barely be aware of their presence, acknowledging [[Ireena]] briefly, but quickly seeming to look through the party like they aren't there.
- Pushing through to another room, there are five other [[Silver Knights]], all appearing the same, except [[Godfrey Gwilyn]]. He has blood dripping down his back as though he has been stabbed there. He explains that the knights stood against [[Strahd]], and failed. *'They no longer know themselves. They know not friend from foe.'*
- The party ask him for help, but he tells them many people come to [[Wiki/Places of Interest/Argynvostholt]] hoping for salvation. 'What makes you different?'
- [[Arabelle]] produces the coin, and he recognises it. It gives him hope. He tells them that on the roof is his partner, [[Vladimir Horngaard]], the leader of the [[Silver Knights]]. He won't go up there, doesn't want to see what remains of him. But he has an iron key that will unlock the Tomb of [[Argynvost]] in the bowels of the base.
- They go through to the back room on their ascent to the roof, finding themselves in the only chapel in [[Barovia]] where the window doesn't face [[Wiki/Places of Interest/Castle Ravenloft]]. [[Ireena]] has a moment and prays at the altar with a dragonborn knight who does not acknowledge them.
- A mural in the room has been slashed, once a depiction of the manor. When [[Neander]] casts *Mending* on it, it flashes with light, revealing the tower above them as it looked in its prime. Picturesque snow-capped mountains hang in the background. The dragonborn knight is overcome.
- We climb the stairs, and [[Ireena]] approaches Vladimir, shouting his name.
- Combat breaks out. The entire party have to rush to keep [[Magda]] alive as she drops to two death saves.
	- (She uses one of the health potions.)
- Scraping through, the entire party level up to level 8.
- [[Ireena]] pulls the iron key from Vladimir's corpse.

**The party ends the session with [[Magda]] on 12 HP, [[Arabelle]] on 31 HP (+12 temp HP), [[Neander]] on X HP, and [[Ireena]] on X HP.**
