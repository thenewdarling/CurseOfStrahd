# Session 40 â€“ 03 May 2023

## *Session beginning Day 31* - [[The Winery]]

- Life has begun to return to the vineyard!
- [[Danika]] is worried that no-one is here to greet them.
- A local bird tells [[Arabelle]] that [[Strahd]] is in the house. A vine tells [[Neander]] the same, by forming a cross.
- The party enter to find [[Strahd]] with his feet up. [[Ireena]] is dishevelled, and the [[Martikovs]] are unconscious on the floor. The kids are notably absent.
- [[Strahd]] takes the Skull of [[Kala]] from [[Arlo]].
- [[Arlo]], with [[Neander]]'s *Flash of Genius*, manages to tie Deception with [[Magda]]'s Insight check on whether something is up.
- [[Magda]] manages to resist [[Strahd]]'s Charm effect this time!!
- [[Strahd]] takes [[Strahd's diary]] from [[Arlo]]'s pocket, revealing he knew he had it. He gives them it back, giving them three days downtime to attune to it.
- He also release [[Van Richten]], who seems to have some kind of ongoing health problem now after a [[Strahd]] encounter.

Strahd leaves, to return in three days to escort us personally to the [[Amber Temple]].

- The party give [[Van Richten]] the [[Antagonising Souls]].
- [[Van Richten]] tells the party that [[Krezk]] is overrun by wraiths after the fall of the [[Krezkovs]]. He went to get eyes for [[Drasilla]]. He also says that [[Rerakir]] is dead.
- [[Vallaki]] is in a state of martial law. The fledgeling council has been disbanded.
- [[Strahd]] has arranged for huge amounts of weapons to be taken to [[Barovia Town]] for a presumed undead army. The [[Vistani]] are no longer allowed to leave for supplies. [[Madame Eva]] just seems to be *gone*. It feels like [[Strahd]] is going full end-timer.
- The children return -- [[Brom]] and [[Bray]], [[Freek and Myrtle]], they seem happy and playing with [[Drasilla]]. They get on with [[Arabelle]] very well.
- The party have wine with the adults and discuss their options, and plan their downtime.
- That night, [[Magda]] casts *Sending* to contact [[Varian]]: "Hello, old friend. We miss you. Where are you? Surely there must be some way we can both get what we want." 
	- To which [[Varian]] responds: "I'm waiting for you."
- She also casts *Commune* (with [[Tenderstem]]'s permission despite not having the long rest to change spells) and gets three answers from [[Asmodeus]]:
	- "Can we defeat [[Strahd]] as we are just now?" (clarification that she means without access to the [[Sun Sword]] etc.) 
		- "No."
	- "Are my friends lying to me about the plan?"
		- "Yes."
	- "Should I trust them?"
		- "I wouldn't." ðŸ˜ˆ

**The party ends the session with the party presumably about to get a long rest with three days downtime. Note that some maximum HPs have been reduced by [[Baba Lysaga]]'s attacks.**
