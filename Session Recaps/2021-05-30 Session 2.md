# Session 2 - 30 May 2021

[[Ismark]] enters, something has happened at the church prior to his father's funeral. He mentions that [[Rurick]]'s son [[Elro]] has been sick for a long time, and is on the cusp of turning to vampirism. 

The party is given a sleeping potion to sedate [[Elro]], and we agree to go help alongside a knight, [[Ireena]] ([[Ismark]]’s sister, [[Callion]]’s other child).

The party attempts to subdue [[Elro]] but he heals from attacks quickly and is climbing the walls. The party are also depleted after the events of the last day. After a few turns of fighting and keeping each other up, the windows of the church shatter, and a cloud of bats fly in.

[[Strahd]] himself has arrived. He performs some kind of charm to subdue [[Elro]], and telekinetically steals the potion from [[Magda]]. He is joined by a servant with a tarnished brass helmet, who stands guard at the door, and has some kind of charm that puts screaming in the party’s heads. He inflicts the frightened condition on [[Jeremiah]], forcing him to retreat. [[Strahd]] has arrived to pay tribute to [[Callion]]. "He was a principled man. We had disagreements but that is behind us, and he always did the right thing in the end."

After [[Strahd]] leaves, the wind dies down but the rain is still heavy. They have some downtime while Irina prepares to take them to the [[Vistani camp]].

[[Magda]] creates two stakes, and they go to the apothecary, [[Bildrith]]'s Mercantile -- but do not buy anything.

[[Ireena]] leads them to the [[Vistani camp]]. They travel through the night, and Irina explains she intends to continue on to Velaki afterwards. She is looking for a famous vampire hunter, [[Van Richten]].

The party pass a gallows, and [[Ireena]] explains with so few resources, the death penalty is often the only way to control crime. [[Jeremiah]] tries to sell [[Ireena]] socialism.

After crossing a river and a crossroads, and a day's travel, the party come to the [[Vistani camp]]. [[Magda]] and [[Jeremiah]] are pulled into a dance. [[Jeremiah]] is well-liked because of the new dances he has to show.

[[Varian]] meets [[Radu]] again and [[Magda]] puts up a lock of her hair in a new game, for [[Varian]] to get his own hair back. The game is confirmed to be rigged, but there's not much they can do without gaining the ire of the camp.

The party talks to [[Arturi]], and he asks if we're here to talk to [[Madame Eva]] like Irina is. Irina leaves [[Madame Eva]]'s tent looking angry, a reaction we haven't seen in her yet.

We learn that [[Vistani]] people are the only ones [[Strahd]] allows to leave the mists of [[Barovia]]. He allows this because they bring back travellers, and he essentially holds their families hostage knowing most will always return.

[[Jeremiah]] steals a lock of hair from someone with a similar white hair colour to himself.

We meet [[Madame Eva]], who gives us a five card spread reading of her tarot deck, and tells us it will have a large impact over the the rest of our adventure.

With that portent, the party settles in for a day of downtime in the [[Vistani camp]], in order to gain the benefit of a long rest beginning next session.


Assuming the party will start the game with the long rest behind them, the session ends with [[Magdalena]] on 35HP, [[Jeremiah]] on 18HP, and [[Varian]] on 23HP.


## Addendum

A late entrance:

[[Arlo]] awakes, feeling as though he must have nodded off for a bit. A thick mist has descended, and he quickly becomes sure these were not the woods he had been in mere hours ago. Shimmying around in the poor visibility, his feet brush up against a small body. A gnome it seems, although one that had seen better days. Poor fellow, if someone hadn’t been so rough with his face, [[Allessandra]] would have surely liked this one.

A raven crows in the trees up ahead, and [[Arlo]] being no stranger to gothic signposting, heads in this direction. Shuffling past some stray zombies, he travels through great stone gates and down into the valley of [[Barovia]].

Cheerfully he walks, admiring the ominous castle looming over the nearby town. This could make a terrific getaway spot. Searching for an inn, [[Arlo]] bumps into a rather flustered looking elf. After brushing himself off, the elf proposes to take [[Arlo]] back to his camp, although they’d have to hurry, a storm was coming. Happy with the offer, in return [[Arlo]] trades a tooth. He hopes the elf won’t mind that it’s not really his own - [[Allessandra]] does such talented dental work you would never know the difference.

They reach the camp in the wee hours of the night, and the next day [[Arlo]] is warmly welcomed by the [[Vistani]] people. A strange elderly woman asks to see [[Arlo]] and gives him the distressing news that he might be stuck here for some while. Three others would arrive soon, perhaps with their help he could one day leave. There was something suitably cryptic about a sword, a destined companion, and a battle for the heart of [[Barovia]]. Apparently, this would all fall into place once the others arrived. For now though, there was a small comfort in the last of the old lady’s words, his [[Allessandra]] knew he was lost and was ready to move hell and earth to reach out to him.

**That night three travellers and their guide do indeed arrive at the camp, a good sign that this soothsayer knows what she’s talking about. The following morning a knight clad in silver armour approaches [[Arlo]], she introduces herself as [[Ireena]]. The elderly woman, [[Madame Eva]], told her there would be a fourth companion waiting to join their company. A fellowship of lost souls.**

## [[Varian]] Whispers Session 2 Downtime: 

[[Rose]] figures out how [[Radu]] was tricking us - he has rigged the table with a sliding door that he operates with his knee, allowing the ball to fall into his lap. The following morning [[Varian]] notices the black book that he found in the forest has some writing on it. It describes memories from his childhood. On the following page, the writing is in a different hand. A shorter entry, it describes the embrace of a mother figure, sitting out by a campfire. He recognises the scene as part of the dream he just had.
