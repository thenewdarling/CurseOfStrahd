# Session 17 -- 17th February 2022
## *Session beginning Day 15*

## [[Krezk]] -- (the night of) Day 15 since the party arrived in [[Barovia]]

Having successfully snuck into [[Krezk]] with his invisibility spell, [[Jeremiah]] does a reconnaissance mission, and before the spell runs out, the party enter the food court and attempt to hide him in a corner.

They introduce him to [[Karloman]], who attempts to be friendly but is clearly terrified.

[[Markug]] spots the extra person in our group, and is on his way over, when [[Magda]] interposes herself between them. When it's clear he's not going to leave her, she uses her new vampire Charm ability and enthralls him, leading him away.

[[Varian]] questions him -- he doesn't know the guard shifts but his sister, [[Areti]], will.

Once it goes dark, they sneak into the [[Abbey]] -- [[Jeremiah]] flying over the fence, [[Magda]] using Spider Climb, and [[Varian]] throwing a rope over for [[Arlo]]. The shining orbs seem to pay them no mind, and the Monk praying at the foot of the pool is in some kind of trance.

The secret entrance is guarded by a statue with the inscription: "We bring water in memory of our saint." The statue is a woman holding her hands out. If [[Arlo]] pours his waterskin into the woman's hands it runs through her fingers.

There's a marker over the pool: "Here lies Kala. This pool was rebuilt in memory of those lost."

[[Jeremiah]] flies down into the pool to retrieve the scales on the bottom, not needing to breathe in his current state. It doesn't damage him, but he is immune to poison so we don't know much more. [[Magda]] suspects it's holy water.

Jumping into the pool seemed to alert the orbs, which start to attack. [[Varian]] provides covering fire, while [[Magda]] guesses the orbs aren't going to stop attacking until the party is past the statue, and that the secret entrance requires water from the pool. She is hanging on a branch over the pool with her Spider Climb.

She drops into the pool, and discovers immediately that it is all holy water. She's soaked, and upon taking damage, uses Misty Escape to teleport to the woman, wringing her sleeves out and filling the statue's hands. They fill halfway, and this time it sticks.

[[Arlo]] soaks his trousers and wrings them into the statue's hands, and the statue starts to open. It takes two turns though, and the party are cornered against the statue, fighting backs to the wall.

[[Jeremiah]] goes down, and seems to enter some kind of trance-like state instead of unconsciousness. We initially assume it's his zombification, and [[Arlo]] grabs him and manages to push him through the opening door first.

[[Magda]] goes down next, and enters the same state -- it's not zombification. The orbs seem to have some kind of life drain; it's why the monk was in a trance.

[[Arlo]] lets [[Varian]] go first, and scoops up [[Magda]]. "Come on, old girl." He backs into the opening, and the orbs stop.

The monk, who was starting to rouse, enters his trance again.

The party, half unconscious and all exhausted, find themselves on the inside of what may be the most dangerous building in [[Krezk]], guilty of breaking and entering if we are discovered.

Great job, guys. We're geniuses.

**The party ends the session with [[Magda]] on 0 HP, [[Jeremiah]] on 0 HP, [[Arlo]] on ?? HP, and [[Varian]] on 21 HP. The entire party have a point of exhaustion, either from travelling through the night, or from the cackle fever.**
