# Session 31 â€“ 17 October 2022

## *Session beginning Day 28*

- [[Ireena]] begins coughing blood after her exertion opening the portal.
- The party find themselves in a garden courtyard, with an arch entering. This is the outermost wall of [[Wiki/Places of Interest/Argynvostholt]]. [[Ireena]] has brought us here as it's one of the two places [[Strahd]] is unable to enter.
- We enter the little groundskeeper's hut and find [[Van Richten]] smoking a pipe. He appears aged fifty years by the trauma he's endured since we last saw him.
- He produces [[Strahd's diary]], giving it to the party for safekeeping.
- He tells us about the [[Amber Temple]], and we tell him about the book we found in [[Tasha]]'s Tower. He reveals there's a cipher in it.
- On the subject of why [[Strahd]] was sending us on a fool's errand to [[Berez]], he theorises two reasons:
	- To lure [[Ireena]] and [[Van Richten]] out of hiding.
	- He knows that many other parties have also been sent to the [[Amber Temple]] and have failed. The last failure cost [[Rahadin]] greatly. He wants to test us.
- [[Van Richten]] examines the [[Holy Symbol of Ravenkind]].
- [[Ireena]] knows she is [[Strahd]]'s sister. In her words, she will die and then experience 'a fate worth than death'.
- According to [[Van Richten]], [[Madame Eva]] has *always* been in [[Barovia]].
- [[Arlo]] begins a twenty-four hour attunement process with [[Strahd's diary]].
- [[Magda]] mentions that she saw [[Ezmerelda]]'s prison. [[Van Richten]] supposes that she is part of the party's foretold fortune. If [[Strahd]] suspects she is part of the prophecy, he will keep her alive.
- [[Arabelle]] worries that the WIZARD card that burned away in her reading was [[Jerry]] after all.
- [[Van Richten]] sees the [[Golem's Eye]], and reanimates it as a boon for the party -- introducing us to [[Neander]].
- [[Magda]] sends a message to [[Jeremiah]]: *'[[Jeremiah]]. Stay strong. We're coming to get you soon. Where are you?'*

## Day 29 - [[Wiki/Places of Interest/Argynvostholt]]

- [[Strahd]] sends [[Ezmerelda]]'s eyeball in a coffin to the hold, towed by the undead horse. [[Magda]] burns it, suspecting surveillance again.
- The party wake, and prepare to enter the hold proper.

*While [[Arlo]] is attuning, [[Ireena]] will be played by [[Kate]] in the sessions within the keep.*

**The party ends the session with [[Magda]] on 27 HP, [[Arlo]] on 31 HP, [[Arabelle]] on 21 HP, and [[Neander]] at full health.**
