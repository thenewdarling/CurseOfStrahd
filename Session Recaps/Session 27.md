# Session 27 â€“ 4 June 2022
## *Session beginning Day 24*

## Midnight going into Day 24

Established: during downtime [[Arabelle]] has been foraging during the journey from [[Yester Hill]] to [[the Winery]] and to [[Vallaki]], gathering supplies to make potions. (If Taanit would like to provide details, I didn't write them down, sorry!)

The party have arrived at the familiar [[Blue Water Inn]] and met [[Danika]] and [[Blinksy]]. [[Blinksy]] is happy to see [[Drasilla]] and is introduced to [[Arabelle]].

(An aside: [[Magda]] blurts out that we hate [[Varian]] now and btw he killed [[Izek]].)

[[Blinksy]] mentions [[Rerakir]] the stable hand in [[Krezk]], who has a glass eye that lets him see through his bird. Perhaps a similar trinket could restore a version of sight to [[Drasilla]].

The party learns that the wizard seen in [[Arabelle]]'s vision is the famous [[Rahadin]], [[Strahd]]'s wizard assistant.

The party make their way up to their rooms for the evening.

___

*The morning of Day 24*

(Downtime:) [[Jeremiah]], who requires less sleep, and [[Magda]] who seems to have slept lightly last night, wake up first. They go hunting for wildlife for [[Magda]] to feed on.

___

[[Arlo]] wakes up, assuming he's the first to wake, and knocks [[Arabelle]]'s door, offering if she wants to go to [[Dargos]] and get his new armour.

On the way there [[Arlo]] explains what happened with the vampires and [[Lady Watcher]], and why the party are seen as heroes to many in [[Vallaki]].

When they arrive at the Weerdo household, there is no response from the door. [[Arlo]] goes round the back and finds the shed, where [[Dargos]] is working.

[[Dargos]] invites them in. The house is understandably a tip, and he has been sleeping on the couch, unable to sleep in his bed alone. [[Arlo]] offers a kind word and an embrace.

[[Dargos]] shows him the armour -- [[Jakob]]'s finest work.

(While this is going on, [[Arabelle]] is Prestidigitating the main room and the dishes clean.) 

[[Dargos]] is going to make a few extra adjustments but it should be ready for him today. He also has robes for [[Jeremiah]].

[[Dargos]] is overcome to see his house as it was, and is resolved to go get his kids back from [[the Winery]].

___

The party regroups at the Blue Water now that everyone will be awake and ready to go.

They discuss how they met [[Luca and Shaun]], and how they might be looking for work at [[the Winery]].

[[Blinksy]] has all his favourite gothic toys with him, he can't leave home without them.

___

[[Arabelle]] and [[Jeremiah]] go to [[Francis]]' apothecary. ([[Magda]] asks her to fetch extra incense.)

[[Blinksy]]'s shop sign has been modified haphazardly while [[Francis]] is using it. It now reads: "IS NO FUN [[FRANCIS]]"

He is not happy to see them, but also is happy that [[Magda]] and [[Varian]] aren't there. [[Jeremiah]] starts asking about potions that will deafen the senses. "Listen to your words."

[[Arabelle]] sells the hag finger for 50 gp -- she is to come by later that day because he needs to get the money together.

___

[[Magda]] and [[Arlo]] go to the Vallakovich Manor -- or what is left of it. It's a crumbling ruin, none of the original structure survived, cleared away.

They chap the door of the nearest house and an old lady answers the door, [[Clara]]. She leads them through and explains how [[Viktor]] and [[Stella]] are living with her now while the castle is being rebuilt as a town hall.

We learn:
- [[Stella]] was threatened into giving up the home by the people, but chose to do so.
- They are getting married when it's feasible to.

We infer:
- [[Ezmerelda]] is likely trapped by [[Strahd]] personally. He's the only one strong enough to hold someone in a pocket dimension for that level of time in [[Barovia]].
- The teleportation circle in [[Watcher Manor]] which now seems to have been defaced, likely leads directly to [[Castle Ravenloft]].

___

[[Jeremiah]] and [[Arabelle]] arrive at the main plaza in the late afternoon and have a barter with [[Shay]] the Kenku. A few things are traded -- notably, the soul-swapping rings are traded for a [[golem's eye]] which could be used to animate an object.

In a moment during the barter, [[Jeremiah]] tries on the ring with [[Arlo]] and they swap bodies -- being in a breathing body again is like ecstasy for poor [[Jerry]], who is completely heartbroken when the rings are traded away.

___

[[Arlo]] goes back for formaldehyde from [[Francis]]' (and presumably his armour?? I don't think we actually showed that on-screen).

The session ends in the late evening.

**The party ends the session on full health, having completed a downtime day and gained the benefits of a long rest.**
