# Session 6 - 18th July 2021
## *Session beginning Day 8*

## Downtime Day - [[Vallaki]] - Day 8 since Arrival in [[Barovia]]

The party eats breakfast in the [[Blue Water Inn]].
[[Varian]] and [[Arlo]] go to find a blacksmith - The [[Authors of Iron]]. [[Varian]] overhears two thieves dissing the place, and suggest the two go to [[Prince Rupert]]'s -- a dragonborn blacksmith who crafts magical weapons imbued with dragon flame, can silver existing weapons, and makes "[[Lifehunt]]" weapons that appear like blown glass.

[[Magda]] goes to investigate the [[Lady Watcher]]'s manor, but achieves nothing but pissing off the guard with her haughtiness.

[[Jeremiah]] goes to a magic store and buys The Little Book of Necromancy, containing first-level necromancy spells. He then goes to the church.

*([[Magdalena]] whisper)* [[Magda]] runs into [[Sasha]] outside the church, who says she knows what she is, and gives her notes on vampirism -- implying that [[Asmodeus]]' pact alone will not be able to hold back her curse.

[[Jeremiah]] and [[Magda]] run into each other outside the church and investigate the history of the [[Abbot]] of [[Krezk]] with [[Father Lucian]]. The Church is grander than in [[Barovia Town]], though desolate. The symbology is the same though, and the window which overlooks [[Wiki/Places of Interest/Castle Ravenloft]] in the background. Apparently he will heal people of a zombie curse, a handful of people a year.

They go to [[Blinksy]]'s. (IS NO FUN? IS NO BLINKSY!) And buy toys for [[Freek and Myrtle]]. [[Blinksy]] recognises [[Arlo]], he has been crafting a doll in the likeness of [[Arlo]] and [[Allessandra]] - after receiving a message from her, to let [[Arlo]] know he's ok and she's thinking of him.

[[Magda]] pays [[Varian]] back for the room cost the night before, and decides now is the time to tell [[Jeremiah]], [[Arlo]] and [[Varian]] about her curse.


## [[Vallaki]] - Day 9 since Arrival in [[Barovia]]

The party plan to go to the [[Baron]]'s after dropping off the toys. [[Freek and Myrtle]]'s dads - [[Jakob]] and [[Dargos]].

[[Ireena]] mentions in passing that the [[Baron]] and [[Baroness]] Vallakovich are "interesting", that the [[Vallakoviches]] founded [[Vallaki]], and the [[Watchers]] are this other ancient family that guarded the wall. (They're like the Uchihas.) The [[Vallakoviches]] don't tolerate despair within the walls.

[[Jakob]] entertains the idea of escaping [[Barovia]], and tells us how a generation ago there was a travelling wizard who led a revolt, but failed and everyone was punished. As such the [[Vallakoviches]] and [[Vallaki]] residents discourage further attempts at escape, seeing it as futile. They also discuss new armours they can craft.

On the way to the [[Baron]]'s, we see a sign for the Festival of the Burning Sun - it has been defaced so it says (ALL WILL BE WÌ¶ HELL). A bunch of kids set fire to it with a firework.

The town captain, [[Izek]], shows up with guards -- and immediately attacks [[Varian]]. [[Varian]] is repeatedly knocked out and revived in the ensuing battle. After [[Danton]] shows up with a cat-like beast who subdues him, he pacifies the crowd and promises to take [[Izek]] to the authorities.

[[Magda]], who had charmed [[Izek]] during the fight, interrogates [[Izek]] briefly. She finds out he had been told some prophecy by [[Madame Eva]], and referred to [[Varian]] as "[[Liadrin]]".

Making their way towards the [[Baron]]'s keep, [[Magda]] asks [[Varian]] if the name means anything to him. He is silent, then says he's not ready to talk about it yet.

**The party ends the session with [[Magda]] on 32HP, [[Jeremiah]] on 18HP, [[Arlo]] on 30HP, and [[Varian]] on 10HP.**

## Addendum

Fighting [[Izek]] also levelled the party up to level 5.

The night the party arrives at [[Vallaki]], [[Jeremiah]] forgets to apply the balm once and moves into the first stage of zombification. 

Before going to find a magic shop [[Jeremiah]] goes to see [[Blinksy]], he purchases a pack of playing cards and gives [[Blinksy]] some extra money to buy a toy for a child who can't afford it.
