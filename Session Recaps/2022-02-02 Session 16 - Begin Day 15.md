# Session 16 -- 2nd February 2022
## [[Krezk]] -- Day 15 since the party arrived in [[Barovia]]

We begin with the party standing outside the gate to [[Krezk]], having trekked up the hill and left their horses with [[Rerakir]] the stable keeper. As [[Jeremiah]] won't be allowed entry, [[Magda]] stays outside with him and [[Varian]] and [[Arlo]] go inside.

The guards make a small cut in [[Varian]] and [[Arlo]]'s hands to show that they still bleed, and explain it's an anti-zombie measure. People undergoing zombification are turned away, and if someone is found to be in [[Krezk]] bitten they are separated in a cell until they turn, at which point they're killed. According to the guards, there's no cure.

They meet Genril, who's short even for a halfling, and grumpy as fuck. We stan. He works for the abbey, and can't be arsed with [[Varian]] and [[Arlo]]'s questions. They hand over 15gp like absolute rubes, and head to the food court.

[[Arlo]] flirts with an old lady and offers to take her soup bowl back, then uses it as a prop to make it look like he's supposed to be here. He talks to a blind monk named [[Karloman]], who explains how the monks in the abbey take a pledge to look upon some powerful light of the [[Morning Lord]]. Some of them are deemed worthy to receive his blessing, and can tend the garden. Looking upon the light blinds any who see it, whether they are deemed worthy or not. [[Karloman]] was not, and so is an outcast.

[[Arlo]] also finds out that the [[abbot]] doesn't leave the abbey, and since zombification isn't allowed in the town, he won't heal zombies. (Whether he CAN now seems to be unclear. Many NPCs think not.) He asks about private quarters and [[Karloman]] mentions something about the [[Krezkovs]]... It seems all of the money goes to them, and the [[Abbot]] is in their pocket.

Meanwhile outside the main gate, [[Magda]] casts Find Familiar to summon [[Eden]] as an owl. The stable keeper [[Rerakir]] psst's them over and reveals that he has a key to the abbey, that he bought from the [[Vistani]] traders in a move that was definitely not the dungeon master trying to give [[Magda]] and [[Jeremiah]] something to do. ðŸ˜‰

[[Rerakir]] has a little crow with a glass eye, called Wes. He can see through the glass eye using a magic item, and so can have the crow fly over the abbey's garden. There's a set of silver scales in a pool, and [[Rerakir]] needs them. If the party will get them for him, he'll give them the key. There are orbs of light that float about ominously but I don't think anyone is sure what they do. We're assuming some kind of sentries.

This is pretty much enough for [[Magda]] but [[Jeremiah]] stops her before she just takes it, and they get the promise of 300gp.

Back inside the walls, [[Arlo]] and [[Varian]] go to talk to the [[Vistani]] traders. Panit, and [[Radu]]'s sister Adriana. They are happy to see [[Arlo]] and [[Varian]] and recognise them from the Night of Merriment oh so long ago (Jesus it's only been two weeks).

The [[Vistani]] traders come here to sell [[Alanatis]] flowers to the [[Krezkovs]]. They're hallucinogenic drugs they import to [[Barovia]] when [[Strahd]] lets them leave on their trading trips. Also, [[Shay]], who is a kenku wares salesperson??? VERY CUTE WE MUST MEET YOU LITTLE BIRD SHOPKEEP

The group reconvenes outside the main gate, and [[Jeremiah]] turns invisible. He walks past the guards behind everyone else. [[Magda]] has her hand cut. Meanwhile [[Magda]] sends [[Eden]] to scout over [[Krezk]] and finds the Abbey garden that [[Rerakir]] had mentioned. Looking through his eyes, she can see the monks milling about and the orb.

[[Jeremiah]] (still invisible) decides to go look for an entrance other than the main doors, and we plan to break in under cover of night.

**The party ends the session with [[Magda]] on 46 HP, [[Jeremiah]] on 26 HP, [[Arlo]] on 65 HP, and [[Varian]] on 28 HP. The entire party have a point of exhaustion, either from travelling through the night, or from the cackle fever.**
