# Session 7 - 28th July 2021

## Vallaki - Day 9 since Arrival in Barovia

The party arrive at the [[Vallakoviches]]' Manor. They learn [[Izek]] was called Dranos as a child.

They meet with [[Baron]] Lito Vallakovich and his wife, the [[Baroness]] [[Lydia]].

Reconvening with [[Viktor]], we learn his once-betrothed [[Stella]] Watcher, (before the two families came into conflict), was altered by a botched Teleportation Circle, and her mind was switched with a cat. The cat with her mind hangs around the Vallakovich's household, while her body is in the Watcher's manor, where they all think she's gone mad. The party agree to help [[Viktor]] save [[Stella]] and hopefully reverse the issue.

We learn of [[Saint Andreal]] of the [[Morning Lord]], who brought the religion to Barovia. Her remains have recently been desecrated but this is not common knowledge, and if it got out it would cause a riot. The [[Vallakoviches]] think this is sabotage by the [[Watchers]].

We learn of [[Argynvosthold]], where the coin [[Jeremiah]] has comes from -- the inscription mentions it: "We are the Light, that watches over the Dark".

The [[Baron]] is either really tight, broke, or both. He wants us to lead the parade that [[Danton]] is running in two daysâ€™ time (Day 11).

We learn [[Izek]] is in prison getting medical attention. Normally he would be put to death for what he's done, but he is a close friend of the [[Vallakoviches]]. Back in the day, he was rescued by them after being left near-dead by the [[Witches of Berez]].

[[Jeremiah]] still wishes to go to [[Krezk]] soon to see about his illness.

We leave the manor, with plans for downtime. [[Varian]] is going to try and visit [[Izek]] in prison against the wishes of the [[Baron]], and [[Magda]] will assist if needed. She also needs to find a beast to feed on relatively soon it seems. [[Jeremiah]] and [[Arlo]] are going to do recon for the break-in to the [[Watchers]]' manor to rescue [[Stella]]'s body.

**The party ends the session with the same HP as they began: [[Magda]] on 32HP, [[Jeremiah]] on 18HP, [[Arlo]] on 30HP, [[Varian]] on 10HP.**
