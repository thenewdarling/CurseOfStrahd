# Session 37 â€“ 25 February 2023

## *Session beginning Day 31* - [[Berez]]

- [[Elm]] takes [[Neander]] to the Initiation Ritual, while [[Gertruda]] and [[Beatrix]] bring [[Arlo]] and [[Magda]], and [[Bromley]] takes [[Arabelle]].
	- Foreshadowing: [[Gertruda]] looks worried.
- [[Arlo]] attempts to question them further about the particulars of the Initiation Ceremony but they are tight-lipped. However, it allows [[Magda]] time to cast *Locate Object* in an attempt to track the [[Skull of Argynvost]]. It doesn't appear to be anywhere within the village.
- They are led into the church, and [[Fang]] and [[Naesela]] are found asleep in a pile, through 'not natural means'.
- The party learn the origin of this version of [[Berez]] -- that [[Baba Lysaga]]'s daughter, [[Minerva]] was taken by the people of [[Berez]] in a witch hunt. Feared unjustly, they viewed her as 'cursed', and tortured and killed her. [[Baba Lysaga]] sought revenge, and [[Strahd]] was happy to oblige.
	- The party suspect that the [[Skull of Argynvost]] is the lynchpin holding the 'paradise' of [[Berez]] in place, and that [[Strahd]] gave her it, but now wants it back.
- The philosophy of [[Berez]] is 'bravery' of a specific kind. Weakness is not tolerated, and those who fail to pull sufficient weight 'for the good of the town' are sentenced to death. 
	- [[Fang]] and [[Naesela]] were determined to not meet this criteria, as they left their friend [[Flynn]] to die.
	- [[Magda]] questions why if the witches are aware that [[Fang]] and [[Naesela]] had this moment of weakness, they are not all guilty by the same association. They clearly had the power to help, were aware of it, and did not.
	- [[Beatrix]] informs them that they had intended to help, and that [[Gertruda]]'s nerve bottled at the last moment. For this reason, she is also put to death.
	- [[Fang]] and [[Naesela]]'s skin begin to bubble and burst, and [[Beatrix]] informs the party that they will be expected to kill all three: [[Fang]], [[Naesela]] and [[Gertruda]], before they are allowed to return.
- During this time, [[Elm]] has been walking around them surreptitiously, and creates a magic circle. They are transported elsewhere. Outside the bubble during this spell cast, all the natives of [[Berez]] appear to age and wither into corpses and dust around them, and they find themselves in...
- [[Old Berez]]. A ramshackled ancient version of the town. The party hypothesise that this is the real [[Berez]] underneath, when [[Baba Lysaga]]'s spell is pulled away.
- [[Magda]] immediately gets a ping on her *Locate Object* spell -- it is to the south, hovering above water. She surmises the party must be in a different dimension to the [[Berez]] they were in previously.
- The party sees [[Baba Lysaga]]'s hut descend into the lake, and then meets [[Jenny]] Greentooth -- the lady from [[Strahd Session 36]] with the vegetable theft. 
- She takes them to her hideout, and explains some of the nature of this plane. She agrees to help the party steal the [[Skull of Argynvost]], on the provision that they retrieve her soul when they enter [[Baba Lysaga]]'s hut. She appears to use a similar method of soul extraction and control as [[Strahd]] and [[Rahadin]].
	- [[Arabelle]] uses *Banishment* on [[Jenny]] as a show of strength.
- Meanwhile, two huge bat creatures circle the cemetery -- what remains of [[Fang]] and [[Naesela]]. [[Gertruda]] has been shackled to a gravestone, as bait. The party agree that killing [[Fang]] and [[Naesela]] now would be... deeply hypocritical, and so agree to attempt to incapacitate them.
- There is an extended fight in the graveyard, during which [[Magda]] frees [[Gertruda]]. When they successfully incapacitate the fiendish transformations, [[Arlo]] harvests one of their tails for the poison.
- [[Arabelle]] successfully casts *Remove Curse* on the unconscious [[Fang]], breaking the transformation spell. He still looks incredibly injured, huge gashes on his back where the wings had grown, and a fractured skull from where the butt of [[Arlo]]'s [[Wife Hunt]] connected. She is unable to cast *Remove Curse* on [[Naesela]] due to casting *Banishment* before, but one of them is safe at least (and the other one has no tail now, which may be an awkward conversation if they save him later).
- While the party seal [[Naesela]] in the mausoleum for safety, [[Gertruda]] explains that her hesitation in bringing [[Flynn]] to [[Berez]] was because her friend had wanted to leave, and then had suddenly changed his mind. Seemingly his entire personality shifted -- [[Bromley]]. It seems he, and who knows how many [[Berez]] citizens, are being coerced magically into staying.
- She also tells us that [[Beatrix]] runs the town, but [[Baba Lysaga]] is the power that keeps the false paradise running.
- Sealing the mausoleum shut, the party prepare for Phase 2 of the plan...

**The party ends the session with [[Magda]] on 59 HP, [[Arlo]] on 86 HP, [[Arabelle]] on 14 HP, and [[Neander]] on X HP.**
