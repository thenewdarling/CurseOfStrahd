# Session 12 (mini) - 21st December 2021

## Vallaki - Day 11 since Arrival in Barovia

The vampire attack begins, ambushing the parade. Everyone jumps into action. Urwin plunges his axe into Jakob's shoulder, overpowering him and staking him.

We fight a first wave of vampire spawn. Jeremiah casts Levitate on himself to raise himself over the crowd and rain down spell-fire. Magda summons a cloud of bats with Spirit Guardians to slow and damage surrounding enemies.

Karl kills the Baron. Sasha arrives to help. We push forward through the crowd to a barricade forming at the front, preventing people from reaching the Church, finding an enormous troll stepping out to attack the townsfolk.

**The party ends with Magda on 37 HP, Jeremiah on 22 HP, Arlo on 31 HP, and Varian on 26HP(+5 temp HP).**
