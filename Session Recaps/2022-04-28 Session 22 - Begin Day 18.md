# Session 22 – 28th April 2022
## Day 18, [[Yester Hill]]

The party finds itself in an underground forest, an eery red glow coming off the earth.  Jeremiah and Varian come down from the tunnel and can hear Magda close by. They move towards the sound of her voice and fighting to find several Shades.

Magda summons her spirit guardians, surrounding herself in a swirl of bats, charged with divine purpose and obliterating any Shade that dares come near. Fighting the remains of [[Nicholas]]’ spirit, a deformed humanoid figure with long fangs for a mouth, the party keeps getting grabbed, blinded and dragged away, constantly being separated. More and more Shades keep appearing, not matter how many are killed.

Arlo is furthest away from the party but keeps advancing through the forest looking for his friends, shrugging off any Shades that come his way. As he gets closer to the sounds of fighting, a soft breeze brushes past and he sees red rose petals float North. He immediately follows it, shouting for the party to follow. Varian slashes at the final Shade in his way and dashes towards Arlo. Magda and Jeremiah get surrounded by Shades and can’t follow immediately.

Arlo follows the petals towards an overgrown thicket with Varian right behind him. Arlo hacks at it to reveal the mostly decomposed body of [[Nicholas]] imprisoned in a tree, holding the hilt of a sword in his hand. Arlo reaches for the hilt and yanks it off the body. As he does so, he hears a loud, piercing screech, and everything goes even darker. Looking around, all he sees is darkness. 

From the corner of his eye, he notices something move in the shadows. He hears scuttling sounds, like little creepers running about but, as he looks in that direction, nothing is there. He stands still, readying himself for whatever is coming, and as he focusses a bit longer, gazing into that darkness, he starts to see the form of a giant spider moving towards him, eight red eyes gazing back, hungry and hateful.

He stands his ground, holding the sword hilt he’s just pulled out of the tree. As the spider moves and gets closer to the light, those eight eyes seem to focus into two and the giant spider takes a more familiar form - coming out of the shadows is Varian, dagger drawn.

Varian asks for the sword but Arlo senses that something is wrong and asks what is going on. Varian explains that Barovia has been severed from the rest of the world for so long that even the Gods have changed here. And he is being tested by their Spider Queen, Arachne, and that he intends to prove his worth. He is going to bring the sword to where she is bound and free her. Together they will defeat the Devil and remake Barovia in her image. Lolth has lost her way, wronged so many and caused so much pain. But with Arachne Varian will start a new order of the Spider Queen, one he can make right.

Arlo listens and responds “I will not trade one fascist for another”.

Varian charges and slashes at Arlo ruthlessly, resolute in getting the hilt. With a heavy heart, Arlo strikes back, hoping to knock Varian out. He hits with Wife, immediately followed by Hunt, and sees Varian drop to the ground. The red glow coming off the earth starts pulsating, dimming, and darkness creeps even closer, engulfing Varian’s body.

Arlo hears movement around him again, and a velvety voice laughing.

*"Although she feeds me bread of bitterness,*
*And sinks into my throat her spider’s tooth,*
*Stealing my breath of life, I will confess*
*I love this cultured hell that tests my youth."*

A giant spider jumps out of the darkness and pins Arlo to the ground, attacking with its fangs. As the red glow pulses, Arlo sees Varian inside the illusion of this spider, red eyes flowing like torches.

*"Darkly I gaze into the days ahead,*
*And see her might and granite wonders there,*
*Beneath the touch of Time’s unerring hand,*
*Like priceless treasures sinking in the sand."*

Arlo goes unconscious as darkness takes over. Varian picks up the hilt, and walks away.

Magda and Jeremiah, keep fighting off [[Nicholas]]’ spirit and the unceasing stream of Shades. Intent on following Varian and finding Arlo, they hack away at their enemies, until a loud shriek fills their ears. [[Nicholas]]’ spirit disappears but they find themselves blocked by a thick wall of webs. Hearing Arlo’s voice on the other side, Jeremiah tries to get through the webs, but gets stuck. Desperate to get across, he blasts a fireball at the webs, burning them away, but scorching himself as well. A remaining Shade senses his weakness and slashes, dropping him unconscious.

Magda finishes off the last of the Shades and everything goes still. The red glow is pulsating with less intensity each time, slowly fading, the only sounds her heavy breathing and the fire crackling away, consuming the last of the webs. Seeing Jeremiah on the ground, she quickly kneels over him and cures his wounds, bringing him back into consciousness.
Before the light goes out, Magda sees Arlo just ahead, lying still, the smell of blood heavy in the air.
