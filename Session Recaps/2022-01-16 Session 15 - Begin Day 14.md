# Session 15 -- 16th January 2022
## On the Road to [[Krezk]] -- Day 14 since the party arrived in [[Barovia]]

The battle for [[Rose]]'s soul begins!!

A wave of zombies approach, with the hellhound in tow. The three [[hags]] -- Bella, Ofelia, and Mog -- aren't far behind.

The first casualty is poor Eden, but the party are firing on all cylinders, all the tricks are coming out. [[Jeremiah]] is raising the zombies we're taking out, and sending them back to fight. [[Arlo]] is throwing Sentinel axes on other people's turns. [[Magda]]'s cloud of bats returns with Spirit Guardians. 

[[Varian]] calls out "Mog is mine!" and fights back to back with [[Magda]] as the scrum starts to converge.

[[Arlo]] finishes the first of the three [[hags]], a day we've been waiting for for seven months of real time. A flurry of blades, living laughing and loving.

The fight is going well, and then [[Magda]] is too slow with the self-healing and goes down. She rolls a death save: success. Mog steps on her head to make sure she's dead -- two automatic failed death saves. [[Varian]], unsure whether or not it'll work due to not knowing the result of the first death save, pours his potion down [[Magda]]'s throat... and she coughs back into life, barely clinging on.

Before they can move again, the hellhound's breath weapon recharges, and blasts [[Arlo]] and [[Magda]] -- she nearly goes down AGAIN but saved the Dex check, and with the reduced damage is on a SINGLE hit point. Then it's her turn -- vampire Regeneration burning five hit dice at once, she shouts a warning to [[Jeremiah]] to stand clear, and casts Silence centered on Mog, killing all spellcasting in the area.

[[Jeremiah]] is bringing his zombies down on the enemies, getting into flanking positions for everyone. [[Varian]] casts [[Lolth]]'s Fire, allowing the party to strike the [[hags]] in the Ethereal Plane. Her location revealed, [[Arlo]] finishes off Ofelia. Mog, escaping the silence, disappears into the Ethereal Plane and for a moment, all is still...

The party regroup, waiting for her to strike.

Mog reappears, hurling a lightning bolt across the battlefield at the group. 

[[Varian]] charges, bloodlust rising. [[Jeremiah]] rushes in down one side to dagger Mog, softening her up. [[Arlo]] rushes the other side and grapples her, and [[Magda]] comes in from behind with a hand on [[Varian]]'s shoulder, casting Cure Wounds. The four of them together, and [[Varian]] delivers the killing blow.

Next, [[Varian]] sees an image of scuttling legs, and clicking mandibles. The spectral form of [[Lolth]] starts to devour Mog's body. [[Varian]] calls out to stop, and a voice implies he has no right to command [[Lolth]]. But, nevertheless, the spider stops its feast.

Mog offers [[Rose]]'s soul back. "In this cursed land, it seems even my sisters and I must fear what lurks in the dark.
I release the child to you, passing from one monster to another."

The soul re-emerges, and in a moment of triumph, re-enters the ring that [[Varian]] still wears.

Mog starts to shuffle off, mostly-dead, into the night, when [[Varian]] says: "Not so fast." And slays the defenseless hag where she stands.

As the real world re-asserts, [[Magda]] heals the rest of the team to full health with Aura of Vitality, when another wave of zombies start to shamble in, hearing the [[hags]]' screaming. 

A beautiful woman on a horse canters in, slicing them down, pulling a flintlock pistol like [[Danton]]'s and shooting a few of them (including [[Jeremiah]]'s unfortunately).

She's impressed, says we fight like demons, and seems to know who we are. She introduces herself as [[Ezmerelda]]. ([[Varian]] immediately puts the pieces together: The [[Vistani Wanderer]]!)

She gives us a variety of information -- she reveals that she travelled over the area where we claim the Tower is, and didn't see it. She also reveals that [[Danton]] was actually the mythical vampire hunter [[Van Richten]] all along!

[[Ezmerelda]] says we will be unable to sleep through the night with the undead hordes shambling around like this, and so we agree to travel with her to the crossroads leading to both the tower and [[Krezk]].

We reach the turn off to the tower, and [[Jeremiah]] makes his stand that we should go to [[Krezk]] first to help him. This is the point he realises that [[Arlo]] never actually knew he was a zombie. [[Ezmerelda]] goes to the Tower without us, and we cross our fingers we'll be able to find [[Van Richten]] after this.

This night, we rest overnight, on the outskirts of [[Krezk]]. (No-one manages to remove their point of exhaustion to my knowledge.)

## Approaching [[Krezk]] -- Day 15 since the party arrived in [[Barovia]]

We wake, and are approaching [[Krezk]]. We notice the fog is thicker out west, and something tells us that's the end of the line -- the outer edge of the world of [[Barovia]]. Inside that fog is likely nothing but madness, death and a fall into infinite nothing.

There is a mountain structure with a path snaking up, and we're walking along the road when we find a horse lying on the ground twitching. It's broken its leg, seemingly having fallen from jumping over the fence. Its rider is underneath it, crushed to death.

A young woman called [[Arabelle]] climbs out of the bushes and puts the horse out of its misery. It's her horse, and the man who had been riding it had been trying to steal it. She is personable, and gives us information about the abbey. She reinforces something that [[Ezmerelda]] also told us -- that the [[Abbot]] doesn't heal many people.

She also seems to immediately clock [[Jeremiah]] and [[Magda]]'s 'situation's. [[Magda]] rankles at this. 
"You're a very perceptive young girl, aren't you?" 
"People have said that, yes." 
"Perhaps you should learn to keep your nose out of other people's business."
[[Arabelle]] seems generally unflustered by this, and wishes us well.

We lead our horses by foot up the thin hill to the abbey, and leave them with a stable hand for a few gold pieces, joining a queue to see the [[Abbot]].

**The party ends the session with [[Magda]] on 46 HP, [[Jeremiah]] on 26 HP, [[Arlo]] on 65 HP, and [[Varian]] on 28 HP. (If I'm remembering right) the entire party have a point of exhaustion, either from travelling through the night, or from the cackle fever.**
