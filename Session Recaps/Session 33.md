# Session 32 ‚Äì 1 December 2022

## *Session beginning Day 29*

- From the corpse of [[Vladimir Horngaard]], [[Arabelle]] takes his holy symbol of the [[Morning Lord]], and [[Neander]] carries his claymore for safekeeping.
- They travel back downstairs, where [[Arabelle]] sees the ground outside begin to shift and murmur like something is coming up out of it.
- [[Arabelle]] returns the holy symbol to [[Godfrey Gwilyn]], who has forgotten who the party are, and is confused and upset. We leave before further provoking him, going through a door towards the Tomb that we now have the key for.
- [[Arabelle]] finds a book -- *The Oath Celestial*, an account of the Holy Empire of [[Valentia]]. A piece of parchment falls out, a note someone has left as they die. ([[Tenderstem]], do you have the text? üëÄ)
- [[Ireena]] discovers a little fire sprite and kills it.
- We enter the Tomb. [[Neander]]'s *Eldritch Cannon* walks between two sconces and a wall of blue fire erupts.
- [[Ireena]], knowing her vision, walks through unharmed, though the others will be burned. [[Magda]] pricks her thumb on *Traitor* to transform into a spider and pass along the ceiling, while [[Arabelle]] casts *Gaseous Form* to pass through as a gas. [[Neander]] walks through taking damage.
- Within the Tomb, we find the skeleton of a mighty dragon hanging overhead, a plaque declaring *Here lies [[Kala]], the Fallen One.*
- We sense the overwhelming presence of a magic portal. Stepping through a door, we find a field on the other side. On that side, the door is free-standing and has nothing behind it.
- *"Welcome."* We are greeted by the spirit of Lord [[Argynvost]], an enormous silver dragon. He provides the following boons:
	- For [[Arlo]] (to be given later): [[Vladimir's Fire]]
	- For [[Magda]]: the [[Starfall Ring]]
	- For [[Arabelle]]: the [[Moonlit Knife]]
	- For [[Neander]]: the [[Demon's Heart]]
	- For [[Jeremiah]] (to be given later): [[Antagonising Souls]]
	- For [[Ireena]]: a dagger of what appears to be black stone, but is actually wood. If and when [[Strahd]] turns her to vampirism, she is to use it to stake herself.

In addition to this, he gives to [[Arabelle]] a thin chain with a pendant full of red liquid, enclosed by a bat. He tells her to keep this a secret.

He says that these items had been gathered by his [[Silver Knights]] over many years -- not all immediately useful to them. Some of them, they had known were destined for us since they received them.

He tells us our plan: after entering the [[Amber Temple]] and breaking the [[Dark Powers]]' hold on [[Strahd]], we will have a small window. There is a secret tunnel underneath [[Castle Ravenloft]] that will provide us an entryway, and allow us to enter, and kill [[Strahd]] while he is vulnerable.

And then he casts *Time Stop*, freezing [[Magda]].

"This is a lie." üê≤

[[Argynvost]] knows [[Strahd]] will interrogate [[Magda]]. [[Strahd]] likely found out about this secret tunnel centuries ago.

[[Argynvost]] can help us more directly, but he requires his skull. The [[Skull of Argynvost]] in [[Berez]] which the Witches have, and [[Strahd]] wants. 

He wants the party to take [[Kala]]'s skull from the other room, keep it in the [[Coin of Portable Hole]], and then swap it with his own. We should use [[Kala]]'s skull as a decoy so [[Strahd]] doesn't know what we're planning. [[Magda]] is not to know this part of the plan -- [[Strahd]] can use his *Charm* to extract the information from her willingly.

He tells [[Arabelle]], once [[Strahd]] has received the false information from [[Magda]], only then can you put this chain around her neck.

He then unstops time, and tells us that we have to hurry -- the devil's servant has found [[Arlo]]. With that the field fades and we find ourselves in the dank tomb once more, rushing to find [[Rahadin]] and the rest of the party formulating in their head how to steal the Skull of [[Kala]] without [[Magda]] noticing...

**The party ends the session with the same HP as before: [[Magda]] on 12 HP, [[Arabelle]] on 31 HP (+12 temp HP), [[Neander]] on X HP, and [[Ireena]] on X HP.**
