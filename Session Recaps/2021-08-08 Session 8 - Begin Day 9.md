# Session 8 - 8th August 2021

## Vallaki - Day 9 since Arrival in Barovia

(In downtime, Jeremiah inquired about a sleeping draught, and Magda went to feed on a chicken to sate the vampire curse.)

Varian and Magda visit the apothecarist Francis, who had previously identified the hags' potions.

We learn information from him: 

The first name of Lady Watcher is Fiona. 

There are no official Thieves' Guilds in Vallaki due to the [[Vallakoviches]], but there are uncoordinated ventures. Izek is the main force that keeps it under wraps.

The prison Izek is kept in is a simple building with a few guards and one inside. It is not big enough for long-term confinement, usually short term or death row. The cell windows are merely slits to let air and light circulate.

They leave, and Varian swoons randomly, as if he will pass out.

*

Meanwhile, Arlo and Jeremiah go on a stakeout of the [[Watchers]]' Manor. There is a lower fence they can break a hole in, or jump over. There's a hedge at the back with an opening leading to a small wooden door. There's windows looking out on the garden (dark at the moment).

They overhear two male voices -- one almost hysterical, one firm. Peering through the gap in the fence, they see the cellar door open -- the two Watcher brothers chuck an elderly man out, tell him not to come back. The elderly man is a bit drunk.

Jeremiah hides from the man, Arlo pretends to be looking for a place of shelter to light his cigar. They talk, and agree to help him. Jeremiah makes this man invisible, and they lead him back to the Blue Water Inn. His name is Henrick van der Voort.

Henrik tells the story of what happened to him:

He was approached by the Watcher brothers. He's the local coffin maker and runs the morgue. He didn't have any prior affiliation with the [[Watchers]] but the money was good. He was instructed to make some coffins but not to take them to the burial grounds, instead to keep them in the upper floor of his house. Just a few to start, but the numbers started to tick up.

Eventually he notices that some of the bodies in the coffins are having small movements. He goes to the [[Watchers]], tries to back out. They put him in a hotel -- the Pale Horse Inn. He tried to back out again, and they threatened him. They forced him to exhume the remains of St Andreal from the church and hide them outside the city.

He is distraught and ashamed. A few hours before this conversation, the Brothers Watcher retrieved the key to the room with the bodies from the morgue.

Varian has a vision which shows the hags seemingly consuming Rose's soul, turning it into some kind of hellhound. Magda consults her notebooks. Hellhounds are fiends, not a pushover but not individually more dangerous than the hags themselves. Notably, she has never heard of hellhounds being created in this way. However, she knows that with Varian's scent, they will be able to chase him anywhere.

A man with a lantern approaches them and gives them an envelope with the Lady Watcher's seal, in the shape of an eye. She wishes to speak with them in two hours (10pm).

They arrive back at the Blue Water Inn and discover Jeremiah and Arlo's situation. Magda tips Danika Martikov 2gp, lets them know that there is an additional person in their room, and asks for discretion. (She doesn't say who it is when prompted.)

We have a toast to Rose's memory, and Ireena finds them and asks what's going on. Magda tells them about the vision of Rose. Ireena is troubled by this. We don't tell her we know where the bones of St Andreal are yet -- we're going to go to Lady Watcher's first.

**10pm** -- we arrive at the [[Watchers]]' Manor. Magda takes the opportunity to rub the invite in the tiefling guard's face this time, who refuses to look at her.

The manor is grand, with marble pillars and red carpets. They are led to Lady Watcher's study -- a grand room with a mirror wall. Magda attempts to hide in the group so it's not as visible that she has no reflection, but Lady Watcher spots it.

Lady. Watcher. Knows. Everything. 

Everything the entire party has done in the city since we've gotten here. She's very upfront about it and reserved, and it's like being in the room with a vengeful god.

She has tipped off the prison guards, and offers us 600gp to kill Izek at midnight when the guards change shift. 300 now, 300 upon completion.

Varian doesn't need to kill Izek now since Rose is dead anyway, but nevertheless we accept the mission.

## Vallaki - Day 10 since Arrival in Barovia

**12am (midnight)** - Varian and Arlo go in to the prison, Jeremiah and Magda make their way round the side of the building.

The guard, paid off by Lady Watcher, gives them a key. "Cell 17."

Varian casts Darkness on Rose's ring, projecting a sphere of 15 foot darkness around them that not even his own darkvision can see through. That way the prisoners won't be able to corroborate who did it. Magda and Jeremiah can use this darkness coming out of the window/wall to work out which cell Izek is in.

Varian enters the cell. They speak briefly, ending with Varian telling him, "You tried."

"I failed."

And those are his final words as Varian assassinates him.

Magda scales the wall of a building as they're escaping, casting Spider Climb and with Jeremiah making her invisible. She stashes the prison cell key in a chimney. She makes note of where she did this so she can come back and get it if she needs to.

They arrive back at the Blue Water, and -- (Liam rolls) -- no one is up.

Henrick is asleep in Jeremiah's room.

We go to bed. Varian has contact with the Dark Powers during the night.

## Varian Dreams...

(Details were never shared to the Session Recap channel.)

___

Varian (being a drow with Trance) wakes up first.

Danton and Danika are talking -- news of Izek's death is already out.

Danika is suspicious as they didn't get home until late. Lots of fingers will be pointing at us as they knew Izek and Varian had beef.

We talk to Ireena, who insists she has more important problems than Vallaki politics. We tell her about Henrick in Jeremiah's room, and about the remains of St. Andreal.

She is going to go and reclaim the bones, while the party go to investigate the bodies in Henrick's home, Magda volunteering because of her experience with the undead. (It's unclear if some of the party are going with Ireena yet.)

**The party ends the session with the same HP as they began: Magda on 32HP, Jeremiah on 22HP, Arlo on 43HP, Varian on 25HP.**
