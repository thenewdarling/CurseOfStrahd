# Session 39 â€“ 19 April 2023

## *Session beginning Day 31* - [[Old Berez]]

- [[Baba Lysaga]] casts *Wall of Fire*, and then teleports back to the hut.
- [[Arabelle]] smashes the containers with the party's souls, [[Jenny]] finds her own soul, but [[Arabelle]] is unable to find [[Bromley]]'s.
- The fight continues. [[Arabelle]] manages to use *Remove Curse* to remove [[Arlo]]'s blindness. [[Arabelle]] drops, and with rolling a 1 on her death saving throw, is killed and requires [[Magda]]'s *Revivify*.
- [[Neander]] manages to read the inscription, and break the spell on the [[Skull of Argynvost]].
- Before [[Baba Lysaga]] makes her escape, while the dimensions are collapsing around us, she casts *Finger of Death* on [[Magda]], knocking her out. The party take advantage of her unconsciousness to swap the skulls without her knowing.
- The river is beginning to burst its banks, and [[Berez]] is about to flood. The party need to make a quick escape, but [[Arabelle]] won't leave without [[Bromley]] until she is forced to by [[Jenny]].
- [[Danika]] arrives in crow form and bids the party away, saying that she couldn't get in until they broke the spell. She leads us out of the village in a skill challenge.
- [[Arabelle]] runs past [[Bromley]]'s noose again, now in the real world. Almost unable to speak, he gasps at her to *'run'*, and again she is forced to escape and leave him.
- In the final step of the skill challenge, the witches blind the party. [[Magda]] uses *Dispel Magic* to remove the blindness effect from [[Arlo]], who has to guide everyone through the tree portal [[Danika]] opened for them.
- The party level up to level 9!

**The party ends the session with [[Magda]] on 20 HP, [[Arlo]] on 98 HP, [[Arabelle]] on 25 HP, and [[Neander]] on X HP. Note that some maximum HPs have been reduced by [[Baba Lysaga]]'s attacks.**
