# Session 28 – 13 Aug 2022
## *Session beginning Day 26*

## Day 26 - [[Vallaki]]

It seems Vallaki has been holding its breath, as the party return to the mists...

Established during downtime, [[Jeremiah]] has had a moment with [[Father Lucian]] and has realised that his zombification will likely never be cured. He flees [[Vallaki]] and goes to live in the woods in a depressive stupor. *(See events of lore document 'Placeholder Jeremiah Title'.)*

The entire party have received an invitation to [[Strahd]]'s castle, including [[Arabelle]] who has never met him. A carriage will arrive to pick them up at dusk.

[[Alek]] and [[Hilda]] arrive. They inform the party that there is a group of mercenaries looking for the [[Heroes of Burning Sun]]. The knowledge that Strahd is looking for the party fills Alek with fear.

Magda sends Jerry a message, and he asks her to leave him alone. [[Arabelle]] uses a new spell she has acquired during downtime, *Locate Person*, to find him. The party attempt to get through to him, and are able to convince him to come with them, but he has taken a nihilistic streak.

The carriage arrives, and we discover that [[Madame Eva]] and [[Ismark]], who is now burgomaster of [[Barovia Town]], also received an invitation and were told to wait.

The empty carriage is towed by a black horse wracked with lacerations. There is no rider. Magda sits in the rider's seat, but there are no reins, and everyone climbs in.

The horse runs impossibly swiftly. The landscape around seems to fade to an inky void as it charges headlong forwards.

Eventually, the carriage breaks through the void, and we are standing at the foot of [[Wiki/Places of Interest/Castle Ravenloft]], a sight we have seen every waking moment in the distance since arriving in [[Barovia]]. Now we are before it it seems impossibly large, towering over the landscape.

The castle's portcullis is lowered, and impossible to pass. However, before we can even get there, the entire bridge is riddled with shambling zombies, and there appears to be a large, writhing mound of flesh guarding the door. As we draw closer, it becomes clear -- it is an undead Beholder, in Strahd's thrall.

Jerry continues to move blindly onwards to reach the hall as combat breaks out, and we ask Ismark and Madame Eva to stand by the carriage.

Arabelle reveals her Eldritch Blast, which for her takes the form of a green energy ray that seems to scatter like petals after striking. She is aware her idol, Madame Eva is watching her.

Jerry discovers the castle walls are surrounded by a Wall of Force spell, and are impassible.

Arlo goes through all of his axes and resorts to throwing his silvered dagger, then enters melee range with the Beholder.

Magda's bats fail to do much damage in this fight, as the enemies are resistant to necrotic damage. After dispatching the beholder with her new Spiritual Weapon -- the trident now black with two burning snakes wrapped around it that hiss and spit -- the beholder... gets back up.

Its eye beams wreak havoc -- petrification, explosions, beams dealing near-fatal damage in a single blow. But eventually, it is put down a second time.

The party stand before the door, already covered in viscera, Arabelle quickly quaffing a healing potion to keep her out of Magda's bloodlust radar.

For the first time in the campaign, the party enter [[Wiki/Places of Interest/Castle Ravenloft]].

Ghostly dancers long since dead waltz around the courtyard, completely unaware of the party's presence. The party pass a statue of [[Yalom]], with large angel wings from his back. It appears he too has been petrified. 

Arabelle leaves flowers at the base of the statue, which immediately wither away and die. Arlo tells her it was still a nice gesture, and she replies that in Barovia, you always need to find the positive side.

We enter the Great Hall, and are greeted by [[Rahadin]], [[Strahd]]'s assistant. When [[Arabelle]] makes eye contact with him, she can hear the screams of his thousands of victims in his eyes.

They are led to the Banquet Hall, where they are poured wine by veiled figures. One of them, with a high enough perception check, we can recognise as [[Sasha]].

Magda attempts a power move, sitting in Strahd's chair before he arrives. 

He arrives, and puts a hand gently on her shoulder, whispering in her ear: *"You're in my seat."*

Rolling with disadvantage, she fails to resist the Charm ability of a Greater Vampire. *"Yes, my Lord."* And she gets up and moves without saying another word.

Strahd wishes to play a game with us. He has a piece of paper for each of the six people at the table, with a truth written on it about someone else at the table.

- I served as the Devil’s watchful eye.
- I spilled the blood of those who were saved.
- I will use you as pawns in my game.
- I will die tonight.
- I failed to return the debt to be paid.
- I belong to another at this table.

Izmark looks at all the pieces of paper, a slow panic descending. "None of these apply to me."

We pass the papers around. Jerry attempts to keep *I will die tonight* and give his paper to Ismark. He is talked into swapping by the rest of the group, as there will be punishment to loved ones in the rest of Barovia if we fail.

After playing his game, the correct answers are burned into the table before us. "It seems you don't know each other as well as you thought." We only got half of them right:

- I served as the Devil’s watchful eye. (ARLO)
- I spilled the blood of those who were saved. (MAGDA)
- I will use you as pawns in my game. (MADAME EVA)
- I will die tonight. (ISMARK)
- I failed to return the debt to be paid. (JEREMIAH)
- I belong to another at this table. (ARABELLE)

The [[Watcher's Eye]], the pendant that Arlo had taken from the body of Lady Watcher and had been wearing until trading it last session -- Strahd had been watching us through it the entire time.

Strahd invites us to eat -- Magda is unable to eat human food anymore, and tells [[Strahd]] she cannot. He brings a young human man out and instructs her through his Charm ability to feed on him. (Welp.)
*Magda's timer will reset on Day 33.*

Arabelle is freaking in her chair. Arlo squeezes her hand under the table.

Strahd points up to the ceiling, and we see it almost looks like a mirror. Inky blackness with a body floating in it, screaming, as if a long way away. [[Ezmerelda]] -- her prison.

Her gun descends from the ceiling into Strahd's hand, and he summarily executes [[Ismark]]. He points out he has brought the leaders of all the surrounding settlements tonight -- [[Vallaki]], [[Barovia Town]], the [[Vistani]] people. The [[Krezkovs]] are notably absent, we will 'see them later tonight'. For now [[Krezk]] can look after itself, but he has decided that [[Nikolai]] Watcher will be in charge of [[Barovia Town]].

"The truth is, I don't want to kill you." He explains his position: he is immortal but he needs the people of [[Barovia]] as livestock, to feed on them. He lets them live, but he must keep them from getting ideas above their station, keep them docile. 

He pulls out a stake and invites Magda to stab him.

*"It will not work, my Lord."*
*"I know. I just want you to see it."*

He guides her hand and forces the stake into his chest. The room chills, dropping several degrees as he dies. Everything goes dark, the candles flicker, and there is a moment of silence. Then he bursts into flames and is reborn, exactly as he was.

The spell that the [[Dark Powers]] put on him to hold him in [[Barovia]], also renders him incapable of dying. In order to kill him, he explains, they will have to remove it. And he wants them to remove it, so he can leave.

The veiled figures arrive to take the food away, and he invites us to the basement, where we will pick up next session.

**The party ends the session with [[Magda]] on 31 HP, [[Jeremiah]] on 12 HP, [[Arlo]] on 78 HP, and [[Arabelle]] on 26 HP.**
