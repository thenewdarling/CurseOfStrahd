# Session 20 -- 20th April 2022
## Day 18 since the party arrived in Barovia - the path to Yester Hill

Investigating the scarecrows proved to be a bad idea. In the middle of dispatching them, we find they explode if hit with fire damage. Varian and Jeremiah investigate their remains, and discover they were animated by some kind of tethered demon.

We continue on the path up the hill, and find a handsome-looking man with dirty clothes that are nevertheless smart and an attempt has been made to keep them clean.

He tells us Yester Hill is named as such because of its view. He shows us that from on top of the hill, for a moment we can see Barovia before Strahd. Vallaki in the distance, a shining city of stone. "Just another form of cruelty", he explains.

His name is Nicholas -- 'Nick if you like'. He confirms when we question him that yes, he is the one who stole the sword, but denies murdering Eliza Day.

The tree has been sundered, as we can see. A huge gash, and something appears to have climbed out of it. He offers us a trade: the location of the sword pointed out on our map, for destroying the tree and setting him free.

Magda agrees, a lie. He tells us the location, and she uses Turn Undead to destroy him on the spot. The party express... discontent lmao. "I've let many undead live for your benefit. But I have one purpose. He was a murderer. But even if he wasn't, he shouldn't be here."

She looks at her unholy symbol, and says under her breath. "He was a murderer, right?" She can't tell if it's a trick of the light, or the skull on the symbol winks at her.

**The party ends the session with Magda on 33 HP, Jeremiah on 26 HP, Arlo on 30 HP, and Varian on 19 HP.**
