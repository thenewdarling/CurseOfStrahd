# Session 41 â€“ 29 April 2024

## *Session beginning Day 32, after a Very Long Rest"* - [[The Winery]]

- [[Neander]] discusses creating a space at [[The Winery]] to live after all is done.
- [[Arabelle]] attunes to [[Strahd's diary]].

## Day 32 + 33 - [[The Winery]]

- [[Neander]] and [[Magda]] attune to [[Strahd's diary]]. We see flashbacks of [[Strahd]]'s history, screaming, and [[Ireena]]'s curse.
- [[Arlo]] sends [[Allessandra]] a message using the *Scroll of Sending*.

*"Allesandra, danger awaits, and every moment without you feels an eternity. But I do not fear - you are in my heart, and i am in good hands. Forever yours,"*

- [[Allessandra]] replies:

_My Darling, they are fools to have kept us from each other, I bid you cut that cursed demi-plane to ribbons. Hurry home my love x_ **

[[Tenderstem]] addition:
**After hearing Alessandra's words, Arlo notices a small weight in his coat pocket. Quietly, he reaches in and finds an unearthly black stone, rough on one side and fine on the other. It appears it could be used to sharpen a blade.**
[[Allessandra]]'s gift can be used to sharpen one weapon at dawn, granting +1 to damage and attack rolls. The sharpened blade gains the ability to make cuts in the fabric of the world itself. As an action, you may cut the space in front of you and step through to a point which you can see. The cut then closes behind you.

- We receive news that [[Strahd]] sent wraiths in the night to attack [[Krezk]] - the religious protections long since withered away. The town is completely overrun.

## Day 34 - [[The Winery]]

- [[Strahd]] arrives, bringing his carriage to take us to [[Mount Ghakis]]. The [[Martikovs]] come with us, and [[Van Richten]] tries to, but [[Strahd]] doesn't allow him.

## Day 35 + 36 - en route to [[Mount Ghakis]]

- At the end of day 36, the party pass [[Luna Lake]].
- In the carriage, [[Arabelle]] draws each of us a card from her tarokka deck. This activates a spell which allows her to offer us some protective magic.

Neander draws the Necromancer.
Arlo draws the Shepherd.
Magda draws the Illusionist.
Ireena draws the Philanthropist.
Arabelle draws the Paladin for herself.

## Day 37 + 38 - en route to [[Mount Ghakis]]

- At the beginning of day 38, the party arrive at the foot of [[Mount Ghakis]]. We are to climb to the top, and reach the [[Amber Temple]]. There are rumours of a monster that guards the mountainside.
- We trek the day, it is snowing and hailing at the bottom of the mountain.
- We see a horse with a lantern over it. With the help of *Pass without Trace*, we hide down the side of the road. [[Arabelle]] casts *Minor Illusion* and we wait, and let the carriage ride past. (We find out later out-of-game this was [[Shay]].)
- Once the carriage passes, we hear the wicked laughter of [[Baba Lysaga]], and then a distant rumble which grows louder and louder...

### An avalanche begins on the mountainside.
