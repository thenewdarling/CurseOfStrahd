# Session 26 â€“ 29 May 2022
## Day 23 - en route to Vallaki

[[Jeremiah]] tries to distract the goblins, including an intimidation and teleportation, saying "You should obey me."

In a short but bloody battle while attempting to kite around the fighting itself, [[Jeremiah]] attempts to sneak attack the goblins using Mirror Image, while [[Magda]] and [[Arlo]] end up taking a bunch of hits from the hill giant. 

It's ended decisively when [[Arabelle]] casts Banishment to send the giant to another dimension for a minute.

[[Magda]] heals the two Elvish captives and attempts to mitigate some of damage to [[Arlo]] and herself using Aura of Vitality and Cure Wounds. They flee the scene before the hill giant returns.

[[Jeremiah]] leads the party back to the path, and we backtrack to get our horses. 

The two captives are [[Luca and Shaun]], merchants from [[Krezk]] who were on their way to Vallaki when they were mugged. They agree to be accompanied to Vallaki for safety. Upon being told they've been saved by the [[Heroes of Burning Sun]], they are amazed, saying "we thought one of you was an elf!" This does not get a happy response. 

After getting the two horses, they let the two injured merchants ride them.

The party briefly (surreptitiously) ask how [[Magda]]'s doing with the bloodlust. Just for a moment, she eyes the two merchants carnivorously.

After the sun goes down, the party pushes on the little bit it takes to get them to Vallaki. We stand on the hill in the dark and look down at the city, lit by candlelight.

## Crossing midnight into Day 24

We arrive at the gate, and the guards recognise us and let us through -- though they're confused that [[Danton]]'s tiger is with us. They send for Alec, who fills us in on what's going on:

- [[Blinksy]] is looking after the Bluewater Inn.
- [[Father Lucian]] is running a hostel out of the Vallakovich Manor for those made homeless in the fire. (The merchants agree to go there for now.)
- [[Francis]]' apothecary is still quarantined because of the cackle fever so he's currently working out of [[Blinksy]]'s shop across the road.
 
We arrive back at the Bluewater Inn, and find [[Danika]] and [[Blinksy]] sitting having a drink when we open the door.

**The party ends the session with [[Magda]] on 46 HP, [[Jeremiah]] on 31 HP, [[Arlo]] on 36 HP, and [[Arabelle]] on 52 HP.**
