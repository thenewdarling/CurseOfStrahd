# Session 42 â€“ 26 May 2024

## *Session beginning Day 38* - [[Mount Ghakis]]

- We escape the avalanche in a skill challenge, and take shelter in the mountainside until we know it's over.
- While we continue to climb, [[Davian]] flies ahead in raven form, and tells us the way to go.
- We arrive at a gate with an enchanted door flanked by two towers. There are goblins in the two towers, and a dilapidated bridge. On the other side there are more goblins in similar towers. Along the bridge are some wandering zombies, and on the front left tower is a nest to an enormous bird.
- [[Arabelle]] casts *Speak with Animals* to ask the bird for passage, but it seems confused. "This is not your bridge" seems to be its consensus.
- [[Arlo]] throws a hunk of meat he has been carrying into a tree to distract the bird.
- [[Magda]] casts *Dispel Magic* to break the enchantment, and [[Neander]] uses a *Fireball* to despatch the goblins all at once. They decide to make a break for it before the bird pipes up.
- [[Magda]] runs to the center of the bridge ahead of the group, and finally pulls off a successful *Turn Undead*. As they are CR1, the zombies are disintegrated. But before they can do anything else, there is a huge flapping of great wings, as the bird's mum arrives.
- The Roc is hundreds of times bigger than us and takes up basically the whole map. We rightfully shit ourselves and try to run. With its first turn it knocks out all of Magda's HP, but she is saved by [[Arabelle]]'s tarot card charm. The Roc tries to carry her away, but [[Arlo]] uses his *Sentinel* attack to throw his returning axe and disarm it.
- We continue to run as it loops around for another strike. [[Neander]] uses *Vortex Warp* to get [[Ireena]] to the other side of the bridge past the gate. [[Arlo]] needs to get the gate open, as [[Arabelle]] runs into the tower and blasts the spooked goblins with *Eldritch Blast*.
- [[Magda]] casts *Death Ward* on herself, to buy one single hit, and then realises the Roc swoops in every time it attacks -- an idea strikes her.
- [[Arlo]] is trying to get the gate open, as [[Ireena]] smashes the bolts holding it closed.
- [[Arabelle]] casts *Invisibility* on herself, [[Ireena]] and [[Arlo]]. [[Arlo]] gets the gate open and holds it.
- [[Magda]] whistles, attracting the Roc's attention, and the Roc swoops down and destroys the middle of the bridge, cutting [[Neander]] off from the rest of the group. She makes it chase her forward, through the gate, and [[Arlo]] drops the gate so it lands on the Roc's neck, pinning it in place.
- [[Neander]] has to jump the gap on the bridge, and squirm through the space into the tower door while the Roc flounders and the party hammer it.
- The Roc smashes the gate and turns to retreat as its child screams. The party run before it changes its mind. ([[Magda]] does send a *Sacred Flame* at it in anger while it escapes, which seems a bit cruel in retrospect.)
- Beaten and bruised, the party take a short rest overnight on the mountainside, deciding to trek onto the [[Amber Temple]] in the morning.

*The session ends on the morning of Day 39.*
