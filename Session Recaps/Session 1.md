# Session 1 - 22 May 2021

- The three player characters have been on a several day ride towards [[Malazan]] in a cart, alongside a fourth person, a gnome called Gnervis who is standoffish towards us.
- The Goblinoid language is officially known as Goblindegook.
- [[Varian]] barely speaks.
- The party stop to make camp for the night, when a mist rolls in. [[Varian]] is still awake due to his Trance ability, and wakes up to discover a shambling zombie coming towards the camp. Gnervis is unconscious, having been bitten, but then starts to move.
- In the course of dispatching the zombies, both [[Varian]] and [[Jeremiah]] are bitten and fail their saving throws. The bite appears infected.
- We see a man on a spectral horse, but following him, the footsteps begin to disappear.
- Walking through the fog, we come to a gate ended by two statues. We failed the DC20 History check to know who the statues are of.
- We find ourselves in the land of [[Barovia]], which has been cut off from the outside world for at least one generation. It is ruled over by [[Strahd]] von Zarovich, who lives in [[Castle Ravenloft]], looming ominously in the distance.
- We talk to [[Mog]], an elderly lady with a cart who sells baked goods, garlic and herbs. She is comforting [[Mary]], who is sobbing about her missing daughter [[Gertruda]].
- [[Varian]] buys three apple toffee cinnamon puff pastries from [[Mog]] for 1gp, and gives one to each player.
- [[Mog]] points us to the '[[Blood on the Vine]]' tavern. A raven flies over our head and perches outside on the sign. [[Magda]] tries to offer the raven part of her pastry but it's uninterested.
- [[Magda]] buys a room with three beds for one night for 5gp from the two people working behind the bar -- [[Alenka and Mirabelle]]. [[Varian]] goes upstairs to freshen up, doffs his armour and leaves his sword and belongings in the room.
- [[Magda]] casts Lesser Restoration on [[Jeremiah]]'s wound and it seems to respond. [[Varian]]'s wound is still infected. 
- We find out about a winery on the other side of the valley in the Svalic Woods - wizards live there but it's the grapes that make the wine here so delicious.
- It's not possible to leave here. The [[Vistani]] people have an encampment. They can pass in and out of the mists, but probably are not likely to be able to take us with them. But they have a soothsayer we can talk to.
- None of the inhabitants say [[Strahd]]'s name -- whether this is a superstition that he can hear them, we don't know.
- The old burgomaster (equivalent of a mayor), [[Callion]], passed away last night. His funeral is tomorrow. His daughter Irina is the new burgomaster, and she has a brother [[Ismark]].
- An elf named [[Radu]] who had been drinking heavily stole a lock of hair from [[Varian]]'s head.
- [[Jeremiah]] showed his card tricks and cup game to the denizens of the bar.
- [[Jeremiah]] owed [[Magda]] a new set of playing cards, but then got the missing card back and gave them back to her.
- There are scholars who live in [[Vallaki]].
- We are about to go see [[Rurick]] at the church about [[Varian]]'s arm, but we're interrupted by two children who need us to help them. They live on the rundown house on the edge of town. Their names are [[Thorn]] (male) and [[Rose]] (female).
- The dog was upset by a window in the attic that was rattling. [[Magda]] goes up and closes it. She sees her reflection in the window briefly, and it turns into a corpse and withers away. She doesn't mention this to the rest of the group as it may inadvertently reveal she's a vampire who normally doesn't have a reflection.
- Dealing with the main problem, [[Jeremiah]] becomes invisible and sneaks into the basement. There is a woman down there surrounded by a pentagram of chalk on the floor. She knew they were in the house from outside the room, and can see through [[Jeremiah]]'s invisibility. 
- [[Varian]] is almost entranced by some kind of spell. [[Magda]] runs into melee, dealing damage with a sword and Spiritual Weapon - but [[Luke]] forgot to actually roll the dice for Cure Wounds, so with 7 HP she immediately goes down.
- [[Varian]], who still doesn't have his armour or weapons, picks up [[Magda]]'s sword and pushes back the shade. (With one failed death saving throw, this stopped the shade from getting an auto-crit and immediately killing [[Magda]].)
- [[Jeremiah]] stabilises [[Magda]] and stands over her body, and as such goes down.
- With 1 HP left on the last boss, [[Varian]] drops.
- Each player has a dream in their subconscious which they haven't relayed to the other characters yet.
- Whatever happens, [[Varian]] wakes up and immediately kills the last shade. Notably he now has red eyes. He wakes the others.
- The two children are now free, and have been ghosts all along. [[Thorn]] moves into the afterlife, but [[Rose]]'s spirit wants to see the world, so decides to inhabit [[Varian]]'s ring.
- Finally, they go to the church to see [[Rurick]] the priest about the zombie bites.
- Lesser Restoration, or a salve which he can provide limited amounts of, will keep the bite infection at bay for one day, but it is degenerative over time. To heal it completely, it needs a Greater Restoration - as a 5th level spell, clerics don't unlock it until 9th level.
- We need to go to [[Krezk]], a powerful [[abbot]] who can cast Greater Restoration.
- [[Varian]]'s zombie bite has apparently vanished somehow...
- We also discover [[Rurick]]'s church worships the [[Morning Lord]], who has a counterpart in the Night Mother - a more fickle god. 
- These are the two main religious deities in the land, though some worship "the Devil" - he says this looking out over [[Castle Ravenloft]]. It's ambiguous whether he means [[Strahd]] worships the Devil, or the people worship [[Strahd]] and he views [[Strahd]] as the Devil.
- Every church in [[Barovia]] has a window that faces [[Castle Ravenloft]], as a constant reminder that it is not only God who watches over them.

## Addendum

During the fight both [[Magda]] and [[Jeremiah]] took some kind of attack that drained their STR score by 1. We do not yet know how permanent it is. (Update: it faded after the short rest.)

**The party end the session with [[Magdalena]] on 8HP, [[Jeremiah]] on 7HP, and [[Varian]] on 17HP, about to take a short rest where we will use Hit Dice to recover HP.**

## [[Magdalena]] Dream Sequence

A dark shadowy figure appeared as [[Magda]] hovered between life and death, and offered to bring her back if she continued down the path of vampirism. "[[Barovia]] is the home of all vampires." Having already sold her soul once and not willing to do so again, she spat in the figure's face, saying "You clearly don't know me very well."


# [[Varian]] Session 1 dream sequence

When [[Varian]] falls in battle, he is contacted by a figure. They offer him strength and power if he swears himself to [[Lolth]]. [[Varian]] accepts it and finds that his eyes now glow red.

# [[Varian]] Session 1 Whispers

[[Varian]] dreams of painful childhood memories, of being left to die in the Underdark and fighting to survive. The darkness was impenetrable, but now the darkness recedes, giving way to the same white light that filled his mind when he fell unconscious on the basement floor. He hears the same voice, and feels his world brighten. The Dancing Lights cantrip returns to him.
