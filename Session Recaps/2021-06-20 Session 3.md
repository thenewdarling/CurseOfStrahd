# Session 3 - 20 June 2021

The party set off with [[Ireena]] on the road towards Vallaki and the mill, with the intent on fighting the [[hags]]. Equipped with help from [[Radu]].

Reaching a gate, they run into [[Sasha]] - who appears to have history with [[Ireena]]. [[Ireena]] grew up visiting [[Strahd]]'s castle as [[Strahd]] often had visits from the local nobility. [[Ireena]] has early childhood memories of the monster that guards [[Strahd]]'s gates.

[[Sasha]] was [[Strahd]]'s partner for a time.

Magdalena notices something and does not inform the rest of the party (yet). [[Sasha]] is wearing a necklace with the symbol of [[Asmodeus]], similar to her holy symbol.

[[Strahd]] was once a great warlord, Ravenloft was a royal line.
The party notice Mog has left the mill, and Varian stealths to see if she's coming closer to them. The party hide the horses, and try to approach the mill.

Varian climbs the mill and hears the other two [[hags]] talking in the cottage.

We end the session with [[Jeremiah]] about to go invisible and investigate inside the mill. 

# Varian Whispers Session 2 Downtime

Varian connects with the spirit of an elderly dwarf man who tells him more about the spectral rider. There are rumours that the rider was the first soul to be trapped in Barovia. That they travel the mists now, forever looking for a way out. Sometimes they find others that have died trying, and the rider passes on the lost trinkets of the deceased.
