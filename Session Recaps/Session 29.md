# Session 29 â€“ 17 Sept 2022
## *Session beginning Day 26*

As [[Strahd]] beckons the party to the basement, he leaves them in the dining room to their own devices, with only his little gremlin [[Cyrus]] to watch over them. They investigate [[Ezmerelda]]'s prison void in the ceiling, [[Magda]] using Spider Climb to walk up the wall and enter, tied with a rope around her waist.

Within the void, it is like swimming in treacle. She takes two points of exhaustion from failed saves, but casts Locate Creature and is able to get a ping - [[Ezmerelda]] is *physically* there, but on the very periphery, and with no direction it is difficult to work out where. Arabelle pulls her back, and she falls onto the table. Arabelle whips up some kind of tonic which removes a point of Magda's exhaustion.

The escape out of the dining room is locked -- another of Strahd's games -- but Cyrus provides a riddle. *"Heart, muscle and mind; behind our name, freedom you'll find."* [[Jeremiah]] works it out: there's a secret door behind the organ.

The door opens on Cyrus' room -- "one of Cyrus's rooms!" -- and initially the party check if they work like the Old Bonegrinder mirror where the hags could see through them. But it seems Cyrus uses them to remind himself what he looks like, being an amalgamation of bodies maintained over time.

They leave Cyrus' room, and enter a turret post with a wall made impassible by cobwebs. [[Arabelle]] investigates Cyrus, giving him first a flower, which he tries to eat, and then a mushroom. She tries to convince him to help them but Cyrus is loyal to Strahd and won't help the "strange girl!!"".

Magda uses Sacred Flame to burn the cobwebs away, and they progress to a spiral staircase. Down the stairs, they can hear [[Stella]]'s screams, so prioritise going down over exploring further.

Stella and [[Viktor]] have been suspended over a vat of acid in a cage, which is slowly descending over time. The acid begins to bubble up, forming a mass of limbs and faces in groaning terror -- the [[Krezkovs]]. (The players are in shock.)

Magda uses her Spider Climb in effect to run onto the roof and try to pull the chain to stop it descending, which makes the problem worse. There's a key, Cyrus tells us -- and we see a cross-shaped keyhole in the base of the cage. Arabelle and Jeremiah tear up the other rooms around the edge while Arlo and Magda distract the Krezkov creature.

Jeremiah finds Cyrus fighting back zombies climbing out of a pot, and has an altercation with them, while Arabelle finds several casks of 'Champagne de la Stomp', but no key yet.

Arlo: "For the moment I'm in acid."

In a final gambit of the Krezkov slime monster, it turns into an exact duplicate of Arlo, and the party have no way of knowing which is which. One Arlo then tries to pull the other into the slime, which telegraphs to everyone which one is real, as Arabelle uncovers the key in a slimy little tunnel in the back of the cellar.

Magda casts Hold Person on the slime creature, and it drops Arlo.

Viktor attempts to be chivalrous and raise Stella up so he will burn in the acid first, but Jerry gets the door open with the key just before. Viktor casts Levitate to catch Arlo before he hits the acid.

With that, the door opens -- Magda sees only a blinding light, but everyone else sees a room decorated in ivory bones, an elephant graveyard from Madame Eva's [[Session 2 Reading]] oh so long ago...

*THE ANARCHIST*
*I see walls of bones, a chandelier of bones, and a table of bones -- all that remains of enemies long forgotten.*

**The party ends the session with [[Magda]] on 36 HP, [[Jeremiah]] on 31 HP, [[Arlo]] on 38 HP, and [[Arabelle]] on 38 HP. Magda retains a point of exhaustion from her time in [[Ezmerelda]]'s prison.**
