# Session 35 â€“ 26 January 2023

## *Session beginning Day 30* - [[Berez]]

- The party continue their downtime day.
- [[Arabelle]] introduces [[Bromley]] to the rest of the party.
- [[Arabelle]] gets a *Potion of Invisibility* from [[Nessa]], and shares the potion to remove a point of exhaustion that she used for [[Magda]] in [[Castle Ravenloft]].
- We meet [[Elm]], an man with a cloak and "funny eyes". He's an elder figure in [[Bromley]]'s life. The fabric of his clothes looks similar to the monks in [[Krezk]].
- The party visit the church building. There is a statue of a solemn-looking angel. The place appears to predate [[The Strahdlamity]] -- a mismatch of old world religions, and their worship has evolved after being cut off from the [[Prime Material Plane]].
- The party relax by the river, when an absent-minded lady drops a large pumpkin and it rolls down the hill. It is followed by carrots and onions. When we help her, she warns us about tomorrow's Initiation Ceremony. She leaves, refusing to tell us her name. Rolling a 27 Perception, [[Magda]] notices she looks like [[Adrianna]].
- The night ends with a feast, a party, dancing, and a fiddle. [[Bromley]] has produced cider.
- [[Neander]] asks about gods and the party has a philosophical debate.
- [[Bromley]] and [[Arabelle]] head up the road.
- [[Arlo]] and [[Magda]] have a waltz, before heading back to rooms at [[The Sleeping Sparrow]].
- Everyone expects this will be the last chill day before the end of the campaign -- [[Magda]] has a flashback to dancing with the [[Vistani]] in [[Session 2]].

## Day 31 - [[Berez]]

- The party are woken, and told it is time for The Initiation Ceremony.
