# Session 9 - 26th August 2021

## Vallaki - Day 10 since Arrival in Barovia

The session opens with the party stealthing to the [[Baron]]'s manor. [[Jeremiah]] uses his ability to move through the city at speed while making [[Arlo]] and [[Henrick]] invisible.

We are trailed on the way by someone who we suspect works for the [[Watchers]], and split up -- [[Arlo]] and [[Henrick]] invisibly going to the manor to wait for us. Varian and Magda regroup after shaking off the person, while [[Jeremiah]] ends up going all the way to [[Blinksy]]'s.

[[Jeremiah]] discovers [[Blinksy]] has been broken into the previous night, by someone who left all his priceless toys but instead elected to steal his supply of silver paint. [[Blinksy]] was out drinking last night (not a usual thing for him to do) and he didn't notice the door had been broken in when he arrived back. [[Jeremiah]] also discovers [[Blinksy]] was brought here as a child, and that his parents died shortly after that. He notes that [[Danton]]'s monkey is still in the shop.

[[Arlo]] and [[Henrick]] discover that there is a wagon outside the [[Baron]]'s manor, and recognise it as [[Danton]]'s.

Magda and Varian meet up with [[Arlo]] and [[Henrick]] outside the [[Baron]]'s manor and ask to be allowed in. The [[Baron]] invites them into his study where he is meeting with [[Danton]].

[[Arlo]] gives the [[Baron]] a fright, and [[Danton]] casts Dispel Magic to reveal that [[Arlo]] and [[Henrick]] are in the room.

We discover [[Danton]] has... vouched for us?? The group is immediately suspicious as to why. But by the time we discover this, we've already started spilling about [[Henrick]]'s story and the bones, and so decide in for a penny, in for a pound.

The [[Baron]] tasks us with "finding [[Izek]]'s killer" by tomorrow, in time for the festival.

After leaving and regrouping with [[Jeremiah]], Magda asks [[Danton]] why he vouched for us, and he asks us to follow him. He says we're being followed, and we stealth into an alleyway.

[[Danton]] is not interested in Vallaki politics, and is thinking of [[Strahd]]. He knows the prophecy we were told by [[Madame Eva]]. He says he will help [[Ireena]], and that there is a tower east of [[Krezk]] -- we should meet him there.

He gives us an invitation to the Watcher's dance, and a detailed, beautiful map of Barovia. We now know where Mafoo Forest is.

*"The devil is watching Vallaki. Though you are only rats in a maze, he does seem to enjoy watching you."*

The person who is following us reaches us, and [[Danton]] pulls out a fucking gun and kills him. He implies [[Blinksy]] made it for him. He is confirmed to be the person who gave Magda and Varian the letter of invitation to the [[Watchers]].

We decide to go to the morgue. On the way, we see many mercantile shops which also look like they've been broken into. All their silver paint has been stolen.

A crow is flying overhead -- seemingly the same crow that we saw on entry to Barovia, and that gave [[Jeremiah]] his coin. (We've seen this crow a LOT of times which may have not made it into the recap this far.) It seems to be following us, and waits across from [[Prince Rupert]]'s. We didn't check if it was still there when we left.

We make a point of stopping by [[Prince Rupert]], who we know works with silvering weapons -- he has not been broken into, however his door is a large stone which is rolled in front of the door. It would be very hard to break into in the night.

Varian uses his thieves' tools to get into the morgue and up into the upper level, before casting a spell to put a spider web-like alarm on the door. We go upstairs and [[Arlo]], an expert gravedigger, opens one coffin with a crowbar.

Inside each one is a vampire spawn. Magda immediately pulls out her stake to kill the one we've opened, but [[Arlo]] stops her -- saying she may wake the others. She doesn't seem to particularly care, but then Varian's alarm spell goes off.

[[Prince Rupert]] arrives up the stairs and sees the scene.

He asks Varian if he did indeed kill [[Izek]]. Varian, thinking there is no way he'll convince him otherwise, admits to it.

[[Prince Rupert]] still trusts us and understands, but wished we'd chosen a better time to do it. He asks us to leave the vampire spawn to their sleep and leads us back to the Blue Water.

[[Blinksy]], Piccolo, Alec, [[Father Lucian]] and the [[Martikovs]] all sit round a table.

*"You know why we're here. [[Lady Watcher]] wants to bring the city to its knees. We're not going to let them."*

**The party ends the session with the same HP as they began: Magda on 32HP, [[Jeremiah]] on 22HP, [[Arlo]] on 43HP, Varian on 25HP.**
