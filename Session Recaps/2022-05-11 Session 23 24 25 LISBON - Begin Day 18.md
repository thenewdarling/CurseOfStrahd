# Session 23, 24, 25 â€“ THE LISBON SPECIAL (11th-16th May 2022)

## Day 18, [[Yester Hill]]

Reeling from the betrayal by [[Varian]], the party regroups and escapes back to [[the Winery]].

## Day 19, [[The Winery]] 

The party arrive back at [[the Winery]], where they discuss what to do next.

They note already the crops at [[the winery]] seem to be rebudding. [[Arabelle]] gives the garden a bit of a helping hand with Plant Growth.

[[Adrianna]] tells the party that like the [[Morning Lord]], [[Mother Night]]'s influence in [[Barovia]] is waning (no pun intended) and she's the last werewolf with control over her powers. There are others in the Mafoo Forest, but they haven't learned to tame the transformation. 

As the party sleep outside, [[Jerry]] spots on his watch a procession of ghosts, leaving the hill and fading away.

## Day 20, [[the Winery]]

The party wake and take the day off in a long rest.

Come evening, when her spell slots return, [[Magda]] attempts to contact [[Ezmerelda]], who appears to be in another dimension -- in total darkness, unable to escape after the events of [[Arabelle]]'s vision.

She also uses Divination to ask [[Asmodeus]] where they might find the hilt of the sword, and is told a cryptic phrase about the Amber Temple.

## Day 21, leaving [[the Winery]]

[[Arabelle]] joins the party as they head to the Tower. Notably we allow [[the Keepers of the Feather]] to organise retrieving [[Dargos]] and bringing him back to [[the Winery]] and his kids by themselves.

## Day 22, arrival at the Tower

It appears to be in ruins. After solving the anagram puzzle on the door, 'HARKS AT DEATH' = '[[TASHA]] THE DARK' the tower proper appears.

[[Arlo]] duels an enchanted suit of armour and kicks its head miles away. He also finds a book on the history of [[Barovia]] that lists the Amber Temple in its contents page, but notably that chapter has been ripped out.

[[Jerry]] does a dance to unlock a chest, and it opens, giving them a bunch of loot including a spider-themed rapier ([[Magda]]: "Mine."), a snazzy pair of magic boots which [[Jerry]] takes, and an Alchemy Jug which [[Jerry]] offers to [[Arabelle]].

They also find two rings that make the wearers swap souls. [[Arlo]] and [[Arabelle]] hang onto them after some hijinks.

[[Jerry]] befriends [[Van Richten]]'s (now blinded) tiger, puts a leash on it, and then [[Arabelle]] uses Beast Speech to befriend it. Its name is [[Drasilla]].

Leaving the Tower behind with no new information, they decide to head to [[Vallaki]], in the hopes that maybe [[Viktor]] will have some information about portals that could lead them to saving [[Ezmerelda]].

## Day 23 - en route to [[Vallaki]]

A roll on a random encounter table later, we see a crowd of goblins attacking a hill giant and two humans unconscious by an overturned cart. [[Jerry]] tries to talk to one of the goblins and go into the fight...

**The party ends with everyone on full health except possibly [[Arlo]] but also like, I'm amazed we managed to keep track of hit points at all.** ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹
