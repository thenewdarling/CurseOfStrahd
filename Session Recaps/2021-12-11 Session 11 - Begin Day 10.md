# Session 11 - 11th December 2021

## Vallaki - Day 10 since Arrival in [[Barovia]]

The session opens with the party still separated, [[Varian]] bleeding out on the floor while [[Magda]] is upstairs at the masquerade.

[[Magda]] is led down to the main hall, offered a small goblet of some dark red sweet port which has a vaguely iron-y tint but doesn't seem to be blood. She doesn't see a way to avoid drinking it in this crowd, so she Partakes™️. It has an effect like a party drug.

Downstairs, [[Nikolai]]'s body continues to be eaten by spiders. [[Varian]] is stabilised, and [[Jeremiah]] animates the skeleton of [[Nikolai]].

Also, this wasn't noted in previous recaps but [[Arlo]]'s Lifehunt weapon has been dubbed Wife Hunt. *Magnifique.*

They successfully end the battle with one pyromancer escaping, and get an occult book.

[[Jeremiah]] leafs through it: "We should collect some blood for this..."
[[Arlo]] lifts the arm he cut off the pyromancer in a salute: "Way ahead of you."

They open the box. Within the Ethereal Plane, the unconscious [[Varian]] sees a blinding light. Within the box are the bones of St. Andreal.

With [[Varian]] on [[Arlo]]'s back, they escape with their quarry.

[[Magda]] sneaks back up the stairs towards the bathroom again, and unlocks [[Stella]]'s room. She locks the door behind her and pockets the key. The Cat Currently Known As [[Stella]] sleeps in the bed, and [[Sasha]] floats outside the room. [[Magda]] is still visibly high off whatever was in that goblet.

She knocks the sleeping catgirl out and bundles her in the duvet as the door rattles.

While she's passing the duvet out the window to [[Sasha]], the door unlocks and opens, revealing [[Karl]] Watcher standing in the door.

As [[Sasha]] flies away, [[Magda]] waves to him and uses Misty Escape to teleport out the window to the ground beneath.

The party reconvenes outside in a rush to leave. On their way out they find [[Lady Watcher]] standing in the road. She tells the party that their conduct has been noted, and that they can expect their friends' deaths will be slow.

She disappears into a cloud of dust as [[Dargos]] runs through her, looking visibly upset. He says that [[Jakob]] is missing, after being accosted in the street with [[Viktor]]. [[Viktor]] was left for dead -- the only reason they know what's happened. In his state, they don't expect [[Viktor]] to last the night.

With [[Jeremiah]]'s invisibility and quick movement through the city, he goes alone to the church to drop the bones of [[Saint Andreal]] off.

The rest of the party go to the [[Baron]]'s manor to see [[Viktor]] and return [[Stella]]'s body to him, but they're turned away by the guards. 

Dejected they return to the [[Blue Water Inn]]. We learn that [[Danika]] has taken both the [[Weerdos]] and their own kids to safety. (There may be more here but notetaking brain went brrrrr.) 

## Vallaki - Day 11 since Arrival in [[Barovia]] - The Day of the Parade

[[Magda]] casts Lesser Restoration on [[Jeremiah]] in the morning. -- I'm going to start explicitly noting these when they happen to be sure.

Irwin has gone to try and get people to evacuate. Alec has distributed the blades [[Prince Rupert]] was able to make. The guards are now at the gates preventing entry and exit from Vallaki. [[Sasha]] has gone to the church.

The party goes to [[Francis]]' apothecary to try and get some health potions at the last minute. [[Magda]] gives [[Arlo]] the 300gp she got from [[Lady Watcher]]'s desk, and he gives 50 of them to [[Francis]] as a good will gesture.

They try one last time to get into the [[Baron]]'s manor and get an audience with [[Viktor]].

Though turned away by the guards again, the Lady Vallakovitch lets the party in and takes them to [[Viktor]], who is bedridden, his body covered in welts and bruises. He is unconscious and it's unclear whether he'll make it. [[Magda]] casts Lesser Restoration and a 3rd level Cure Wounds on him, and his wounds appear to heal somewhat, and he regains consciousness.

After allowing his mother a moment, [[Varian]] questions the boy. (I don't have notes of what he asked, but from memory it was just what had happened to him and [[Jakob]] of which he didn't know. Also to tell him that Cat![[Stella]] is in the [[Blue Water Inn]]). It's clear the [[Vallakoviches]] are completely unaware of the Watcher's vampire plot, and will not listen to reason.

With that, the [[Baron]] leads the party to go and lead the parade as the original plan dictated. They pass the stocks, and find [[Henrick]], hanged, with the word "TRAITOR" painted across his chest. With guilt in their hearts, they listen to the [[Baron]]'s speech:

*Citizens of Vallaki, last night my son was attacked in our streets, and brought within an inch of death!*

*I have dedicated my life to keeping the devil of this land at bay, but it seems I have underestimated the villainy of my own neighbours. It is obvious who did this, today the Watcher household shall fall. We will burn them to ash.*

The [[Baron]] lights a bonfire and means to take the mob down the street towards the [[Watchers]] where he will burn their manor down and kill all of them.

[[Urwin]], [[Prince Rupert]] and [[Sasha]] join the party on the march, everyone filled with dread for what is to come, when a thick fog rolls down the street...

From where the party is, they can't make out what's happening, but they are sure they know what it is. Screaming, the sound of flesh tearing and viscera. Pushing through the fog, they find a soldier on the ground, face torn open, and standing over him, eyes large and pale with a mouth laden with sharp fangs...

[[Jakob]] Weerdo.

**The party ends the session with [[Magda]] on 35HP, [[Varian]] on 26HP(+5 temporary HP), [[Arlo]] on 54HP and [[Jeremiah]] on 21HP.**
