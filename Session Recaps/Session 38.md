# Session 38 â€“ 12 April 2023

## *Session beginning Day 31* - [[Old Berez]]

- The session opens with the party taking [[Fang]] and [[Gertruda]] back to [[Jenny]] Greentooth's hiding place.
- [[Magda]] casts *Sending* to reach out to [[Jenny]], burning the slot on the *Spell-Refuelling Ring*. [[Jenny]] asks them to come to the town hall to prepare for the ritual.
- On the way, the party pass a spectral gallows in the courtyard. About ten people are hanged. The party initially don't want to approach, and [[Magda]] sends [[Eden]] to scout. 
	- Seeing through his eyes, she recognises [[Bromley]] but not the others. She describes [[Mordesh]] and [[Arabelle]] recognises her. The party decide to approach after all.
	- Some of the people appear to be the people [[Arabelle]] has been seeing in her dreams. The people who killed [[Baba Lysaga]]'s daughter.
	- [[Arabelle]] holds [[Bromley]]'s leg. He appears to tear up. They confirm that there is some form of undead presence, that their spirits are still there and it isn't an illusion or a memory.
- Arriving at the town hall, [[Arabelle]] performs a ritual using her ingredients to allow the party a long rest in the eight hours of restfulness they will get while they wait for dusk -- when [[Baba Lysaga]] will emerge from her hut.
- [[Jenny]] draws ink markings on everyone's arms. She says that stealing the [[Skull of Argynvost]] will cause the two versions of [[Berez]] to collapse together, and the markings are the only thing that will prevent their souls (fragmented in [[Baba Lysaga]]'s hut) from being completely lost.
- [[Arlo]] finally uses the poison from his *Paralysing Tentacle* to apply a poison to one of his axes -- *Love*, the one which automatically returns. It will apply an approximation of the effects of a *Hold Person* spell twice.
- With the benefits of a long rest coming, [[Magda]] burns all her third and fourth level spell slots to cast repeated *Sending* messages, getting the following responses:
	- From [[Bromley]]: the message seems to split into two, and there is no response.
	- To [[Van Richten]]: He is alive, and in [[Krezk]] on business that will need to happen before their plan comes to fruition.
	- From [[Ireena]]: feverish mumbling, incoherent. She is clearly in some kind of pain.
	- From [[Adrianna]], who we inform of finding [[Jenny]]: "That old goat is still alive?!" She says she still believes in [[Jenny]], and to tell her to get them all home safe.
- The party chat during downtime, more with [[Neander]] on the nature of souls, and how to distribute [[Arabelle]]'s *Potions of Healing*. ([[Arlo]] declines one: "I'm beefy, darling.")
- The time comes, and the party approach the place where they know the [[Skull of Argynvost]] to be.  [[Baba Lysaga]]'s hut rises out of the river and approaches. 
- [[Arabelle]] casts *Invisibility* on herself and [[Jenny]], so they can sneak into the hut.
- [[Baba Lysaga]] knows we haven't killed [[Fang]], [[Naesela]] and [[Gertruda]] as she wished. She steps out of the hut, laughs, and disappears. Her hunt begins.
- [[Arlo]], [[Neander]] and [[Magda]] approach the skull, and [[Baba Lysaga]] casts *Call Lightning* from behind them, appearing from the trees. As we all accidentally seemed to line up, everyone is hit.
- [[Arabelle]] manages to sneak into [[Baba Lysaga]]'s hut, while [[Jenny]] gets caught in its tendrils. Inside she finds crystals hanging everywhere, containing the people's souls. She rushes through them, trying to find people she recognises -- discovering the four party members are on the desk. Above the desk is a portrait of an older women, and what appears to be a teenage [[Ireena]].
- [[Baba Lysaga]] casts a spell to blind [[Arlo]], but he manages to get a hit in with *Love* and paralyses her, giving the entire party at least one turn to attack her. (It also neutralises the disadvantage from being blinded, for now.)
- We end the session in mid-combat, and move to player-huddle to make plans.... ðŸ˜ˆ

**The party ends the session with [[Magda]] on 58 HP, [[Arlo]] on 97 HP, [[Arabelle]] on 18 HP, and [[Neander]] on X HP.**
