# Session 14 -- 8th January 2022
## *Session beginning Day 11*

## [[Vallaki]] - Day 11 since Arrival in [[Barovia]]

*(Out of character -- [[Kate]] is group treasurer now.)*

After discovering the [[Vallakoviches]]' Manor has been burned down by [[Karl]] Watcher, we escort [[Viktor]], his mother, and the newly recovered [[Stella]] to the [[Watcher Manor]], where they can stay for now while the town is in chaos. [[Viktor]] explains that they were able to escape to safety through the Teleportation Circle [[Viktor]] was testing that made [[Stella]] a cat to begin with, and thus they were at Alec's when the house actually began to burn down.

On the way to the [[Watchers]]' Manor, there is looting in the streets, and the party happen to run into Alec, who doesn't know what happened to [[Nikolai]] and [[Lady Watcher]].

We split up to help the relief effort -- Team Edgy ([[Varian]] and [[Magda]]) go to help the hurt people in the battle, and Team Cool ([[Arlo]] and [[Jeremiah]]) go to help the church deal with the wreckage.

[[Arlo]] lifts a door back into place while [[Jeremiah]] tries to work out how to fix it with magic. [[Arlo]]: "I'm not a magic man! I just hold the doors!"

[[Prince Rupert]] uses his dragonborn breath weapon to make new stained glass windows for the church. [[Father Lucian]] provides [[Jeremiah]] with some more holy water. They discover [[Blinksy]] likely has the only key to the [[Blue Water Inn]], where they were going to stay for the night.

Team Edgy are waylaid when they come across people looting [[Francis]]' apothecary. After failing to intimidate them into leaving, one of them breaks open a box under [[Francis]]' desk, smashing the [[potion of cackle fever]] he had confiscated from the party.

Remembering that this is highly contagious, [[Varian]] and [[Magda]] quarantine the looters in the room with them, and [[Varian]] gags them all. 

[[Arlo]] and [[Varian]] walk past on the way to [[Blinksy]]'s, and [[Magda]] uses Thaumaturgy to pass a message out to them. 

[[Arlo]]: "Back in my day we used to walk it off if we got sick."
[[Magda]]: "I'm two hundred years older than you!"

They go out and find [[Francis]], who comes back to get the antidote he had been creating in the back of the shop. [[Magda]] casts Silence as a ritual around them all to prevent them giving him the cackle fever.

Using tongs to pass in the antidote, they all drink from the potion. It doesn't prevent the exhaustion, but it does stop the laughing, which prevents them from spreading it around. By the end of the session, both [[Varian]] and [[Magda]] succeed on one saving throw of two required to remove the point of exhaustion. [[Magda]] pockets a Potion of Squeaky Voice (roll 1d8, the result is the amount of hours of squeaky voice inflicted on the drinker).

The party arrive at [[Blinksy]]'s, and find him with his little monkey Piccolo. He gives them the key to the Blue Water, and also gives [[Arlo]] the toys he crafted of him and [[Allessandra]]. [[Arlo]] puts the Alessandra toy in his breast pocket over his heart.

Exhausted, the party arrive back at the Blue Water, stock the bar with wine from the portable hole, have a drink, refresh themselves, and get a well-deserved night's sleep.

(Note: the events of [[Magda]] backstory "Here, in the Garden" happens now.)


## [[Vallaki]] -- Day 12 since the party arrived in [[Barovia]]

[[Magda]] prepares a salve for [[Jeremiah]] from the holy water, beeswax, etc. [[Arlo]] attunes to the [[Lady Watcher]]'s amulet, and hangs it like a pocket watch in his waistcoat.

[[Father Lucian]] chaps the door. He has a conversation with [[Jeremiah]] about more holy water, and asks [[Jeremiah]] if he can contact the [[Abbot]] of [[Krezk]], and rekindle his faith. After the conversation with [[Strahd]], and losing the bones of [[Saint Andreal]], he has lost his faith that the [[Morning Lord]] is still watching over them.

[[Dargos]] is still bullish about making the armour -- [[Jakob]]'s greatest work. The party pays him 500gp, and agrees to stop by [[the winery]] to find out what the status with his children, who left with [[Danika]] Martikov when the fighting broke out.

Later in the day, we arrive at the town centre to hear the speech by the surviving [[Vallakoviches]] and the [[Watchers]].

[[Viktor]] speaks about how the two families were once allies, and he would like them to be again. The [[Watchers]] built these walls to keep evils out of the city, but that they also need to be aware of evils inside the city at the same time.

He names [[Alek]] as the new captain of the city guard.

He asks the people of [[Vallaki]] to give thanks to us, remembering yesterday as the Feast of [[Saint Andreal]], and dubbing us "the [[Heroes of Burning Sun]]" (yo party name??)

Finally, [[Father Lucian]] reveals to [[Jeremiah]] that to his memory, there was a holy water source at [[the winery]].

We go to the [[Watcher Manor]], where the [[Vallakoviches]] now live with [[Stella]]. It doesn't carry the same air it once did. [[Magda]] chooses to remain downstairs, not wishing to see them -- whether she feels guilt about entreating the devil to save [[Viktor]]'s life, or for killing and drinking the blood of [[Stella]]'s mother, she does not say.

The party ask about [[Sasha]]. [[Lydia]] says that [[Sasha]] has her sympathies, but she chose this life. The party also reveal that [[Lady Watcher]] was killed "by [[Strahd]]" -- [[Arlo]] and [[Jeremiah]] specifically speak over [[Varian]] revealing that [[Magda]] gave the killing blow.

The night ends with a party -- [[Blinksy]] asking the party to donate some of the wine they nicked from the [[Watchers]]. He unleashes a mighty firework display and the town of [[Vallaki]] seems happier than it has for a while. [[Magda]] goes to bed early, trying to minimise temptation.

[[Arlo]] reminds [[Viktor]] and [[Stella]] that they have a strong support network, and to not take the full burden of what's to come on their shoulders. They also ask them to help [[Dargos]] finish the armour if possible.

With that the party concludes their long rest, unlocking their full 6th level abilities. 

## Riding out of [[Vallaki]] -- Day 13 since the party arrived in [[Barovia]]

[[Magda]] prepares more salve. The party ride out towards the tower on the road to [[Krezk]].

[[Varian]] notices they are being followed throughout the day. As night falls, and the Barovian mists begin to roll in, they suppose that whoever is following them will likely not be able to see them either, and they stop to rest for the evening.

## On the Road to the Tower at [[Krezk]] -- Day 14 since the party arrived in [[Barovia]]

As midnight passes, [[Magda]] takes first watch, and when she hears snarling out in the fog, she sends her new familiar [[Eden]] to have a look.

[[Varian]] has a nightmare of being chased by a hell hound, [[Rose]]'s captor. He awakes in a cold sweat.

[[Magda]] rouses the party, as zombies and the hell hound draw close...

**The party ends the session with [[Magda]] on 52 HP with one save remaining to remove her point of exhaustion, [[Jeremiah]] on 26 HP, [[Arlo]] on 65 HP, and [[Varian]] on 28 HP with one save remaining to remove his point of exhaustion.**
