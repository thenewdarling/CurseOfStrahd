# Session 18 -- 18th February 2022
## [[Krezk]] -- crossing midnight into Day 16 since the party arrived in Barovia

As Magda and Jeremiah are roused from their Life Drain sleep, the party consider their options -- inside the Krezkov's home.

Varian scouts upstairs, hearing the Krezkovs imbibing some kind of smoke (likely the Alanatis plant we were told about), and some kind of torture happening to a half-elven woman. The party don't think they're in a position for a fight, and are just looking for the [[Abbot]], so they go south -- which Arlo scouts using the ring of [[Lady Watcher]].

The find a little square room with a man working on something in the corner, and Varian sneaks up and tries to cover his mouth.

The man grabs his hand without even looking up, and proceeds to force a combat, summoning a huge greatsword. The party make multiple attempts to deescalate, but the fighting only stops when a ghost next door is roused from his slumber -- [[Sergei]].

He reveals the [[Abbot]]'s name, [[Yalom]], and stops the fight. We find out what [[Yalom]]'s deal is. He sacrifices people to give the Krezkovs immortal life. We see this while we need to hide. A Krezkov woman with a veil covering a more rotten face than even Jeremiah enters. The party hide, while a platform drops from the ceiling -- revealing the half-elven woman from before. The half-elf woman is drained of her essence, and the Krezkov lady is restored to youthful life.

We find out [[Yalom]] also invented the zombie curse at [[Strahd]]'s behest, right as Jeremiah's hand falls off. [[Yalom]] and [[Sergei]] have been trapped in this room for hundreds of years.

[[Sergei]] asks for permission to tell his story, to which Taanit (maybe also Varian?) says "Hell yeah!"

He was [[Strahd]]'s mentor, best friend, and brother-in-law. He has died, but nothing leaves Barovia, even in death. He tells us of his love, Tatiana -- [[Strahd]]'s sister. At some point in her life she became ill and was meant to die naturally, but made some kind of dark pact. At first she started feeling better and recovering from that illness, but soon started having cravings - she seems to have been made a vampire by that pact. She tried to contain the urges and was struggling, so her and [[Sergei]] went away to hide and protect other people. Eventually Tatiana succumbed and killed [[Sergei]]. He never told us how Tatiana herself died, only that the world caught up and killed her? After that first death she seems to keep reincarnating, although without memory of her past lives, or at least at first. She is now cursed to fall ill, to die, and turn to vampirism over and over again. But we likely know her under another name -- he shows us a locket containing the face of [[Ireena]]. (GASP!) 

[[Yalom]] can't heal Jeremiah's curse, but he can freeze it in his tracks. He sews Jeremiah's hand back on, and gives him a black ooze which prevents the zombification from getting worse. In exchange, he asks us to retrieve a weapon which he was supposed to destroy, but fate seemed to decide it wasn't its time yet... (We gather this is the Sun Sword from [[Madame Eva]]'s reading.)

[[Sergei]] shows us an exit which leads us out further down the mountain, past the borders of the city. Knowing no doubt [[Markug]]'s charm effect has worn off and he's told everyone, we're in deep trouble -- we head down to find [[Arabelle]]'s home, as [[Sergei]] tells us she can offer us another reading.

Eventually finding her in the fields outside [[Krezk]], she seems to know we were coming. She offers us a bed for the night, and in the morning she's poking at a roast chicken in the oven.

"Sometimes, people who are lost need someone to tell them where to go."

She gives us a reading, and in the beginning, the cards reading of history match [[Madame Eva]]'s reading-- but burst into flames. The reading diverges though, and The Wizard card reforms in Jeremiah's hand after being destroyed. (This card was what was sent up in the post ;D)

## [[Arabelle]]'s Reading

**The WIZARD**: Where once was knowledge now there is death.

**The THIEF**: A sword that was taken, shall be stolen once more.

**The ANARCHIST**: An ancient force is biding its time.

**The HORSEMAN**: A lost soul returned, and now she is lost.

**The TEMPTER**: Fear not only the Devil, but the Dark itself.


We leave the party in [[Arabelle]]'s home, unsure of what comes next -- but absolutely soaking in vibes.

**The party ends the session with Magda on 7 HP, Jeremiah on 8 HP, Arlo on 8 HP, and Varian on 21 HP. The exhaustion has passed, thank god.**
