Drow societies are ruled by females who worship Lolth, the spider-goddess who favours evil and corruption. Males, who have weaker magical abilities, if any, tend to be fighters and hone their physical prowess in order to survive and to keep away from the attention of the priestesses.

[[Varian]] comes from a very wealthy and influential drow family. At a very young age he was sent to Ravencrest Hold by his aunt Onyxia, to be trained as his family's personal assassin. Onyxia is head of the Lo'Gosh family.

In Ravencrest Hold, a rogue’s academy, [[Varian]] was taught to be a ruthless and cold blooded assassin. Children who showed kindness or love were brutally punished, so as to beat the instinct for cruelty into them. After 200 years of training, [[Varian]] was released and began doing his family’s dark biddings.

[[Varian]] is very mistrustful of magic and hates it, always associating it with the worship of evil gods and reminding him of all he went through because of his lack of it. Of course, deep down, he wishes he could have been born with magic as to avoid all the pain his childhood was permeated with.
