# DOWNTIME - VALLAKI

## The characters discuss plans

I know what we should do with our money! But it'll look so suspicious to pay it in just now...
Our commissioned armour with the Weerdo's
It was about 600GP total, right? Selfishly, I only wrote down that [[Varian]]'s would be 50

[09-Aug-21 05:50 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
I think so yeah, that was to cover everyone's including [[Freek and Myrtle]]'s das
we only have 300 of it right now, but I WOULD like to use it as a big "hey who do you think paid us to do this"
since it kind of seems like even the [[Vallakoviches]] don't have that kind of money lying around

[09-Aug-21 05:55 PM] [[Varian]] Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Huh? Who do you want to tell about the money?

[09-Aug-21 06:01 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
If we get Found Out, Accused! It's an alternative to just trying to lie about it, which I think won't work
but I guess it depends who we talk to first ðŸ˜† maybe it won't come to that

[09-Aug-21 06:14 PM] [[Varian]] Lo'Gosh (he/him)
You're right

[09-Aug-21 10:24 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
here if we get out of this, I'm gonna be so impressed by us?

[09-Aug-21 10:25 PM] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him)
Don't be impressed til we do it!

[09-Aug-21 10:25 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
I honestly think we might just all be killed ðŸ˜†

[10-Aug-21 10:07 AM] [[Arlo]] de LeÃ³n (he/him)
Do you have zone of truth @thenewdarling ?

[10-Aug-21 10:07 AM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
I don't have it prepared T__T
We should move this to #player-huddle now that i think of it haha

## Tasha makes herself known

At breakfast [[Urwin]] comes over to you and puts a small envelope on your table, â€œAlmost forgot in all the chaos this morning, [[Jakob]] came by with this. I hope it's good news."

The letter reads:

*Friends,

I have been digging around since we spoke, and it occurred to me that perhaps young [[Viktor]] might be of help in identifying our lost wizard. I mentioned to him your interest and he became most exited indeed! His grandfather hid most of the cityâ€™s records decades back, but [[Viktor]] has since recovered many of the arcane texts for his studies. We have uncovered a name, Iggwilv.

You may know her as [[Tasha]] the Dark.
