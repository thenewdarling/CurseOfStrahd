Hey, uh @thenewdarling you've ticked off a spell slot for my lesser restoration right?


[21-Nov-21 10:50 AM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
right?


[21-Nov-21 10:51 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
S- sure I can have done that lmao


[21-Nov-21 10:52 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Wait are we at the point where I’m needing to cast it every day?

Kinda yeah


[21-Nov-21 10:52 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Do we not have any more beeswax and holy water?


[21-Nov-21 10:52 AM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
I'm out of salve til we get dem bones


[21-Nov-21 10:52 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Wait I’m like 90% sure a day hasn’t passed since I last did it


[21-Nov-21 10:53 AM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
bones make the church not desecrated, allows for holy water


[21-Nov-21 10:53 AM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
We had a long rest though


[21-Nov-21 10:53 AM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
so a day passed


[21-Nov-21 10:54 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
The long rest was the day we spent walking around the town etc etc, i definitely cast it on that day


[21-Nov-21 10:55 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Like we’re actually counting the amount of 24 Hour Periods in [[Strahd]], not just between long rests


[21-Nov-21 10:55 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
It’s getting late in the day but so long as I cast it on you tomorrow we should be fine


[21-Nov-21 10:55 AM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
I thought we needed to not cast to get the long rest


[21-Nov-21 10:56 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
If that’s the case you’re fucked XD cos if you need it every day and a long rest requires 24 hours without casting a spell


[21-Nov-21 10:56 AM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
Eh, we'll figure it out


[21-Nov-21 11:09 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
I’ll need to double-check, I don’t even think I put it in the session recap because I’m a FOOL


[21-Nov-21 11:09 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
I’ll start putting whether i cast it or not at the top of every session recap where I say what day it is


[21-Nov-21 01:39 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Here @Liam, is there like a picture of what we know abt the house layout so far 😇 I may have not written any of it down


[21-Nov-21 01:40 PM] TenderstDM
Ooh, I have notes, and can certainly post you a sketch!


[21-Nov-21 01:41 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Aaa thank u!! 😭❤️ I promise in return I’ll come up with a ridiculous scheme lmao


[21-Nov-21 02:31 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Unrelated but necessary for aesthetic: @Liam did u describe the appearance of my masquerade mask? Im asking cos I’m like “maybe she’ll just wear it for the rest of the campaign” lmao
