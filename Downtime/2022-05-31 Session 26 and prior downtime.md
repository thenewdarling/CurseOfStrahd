(Can I have Magda gather the materials for Find Familiar in the wee house?)


[10-Mar-22 04:36 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
like if [[Arabelle]] would have them lying around


[19-Mar-22 03:21 PM] TenderstDM
Absolutely, sorry I didn't see this!


[19-Mar-22 03:21 PM] TenderstDM
What is it you're looking for?


[19-Mar-22 03:23 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
10gp worth of charcoal, incense, and herbs


[19-Mar-22 03:23 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
;D


[19-Mar-22 03:55 PM] TenderstDM
[[Arabelle]] drags a stool over by the kitchen table, she hops up and starts rummaging around the top shelves. She comes back down with a few sage leaves and then scoops some charcoal out from the back of the stove. For a moment it looks as if she's forgotten something, before she reaches into her apron pocket, pulling out a handful of little incense cones.
"That do you?"

Magda smiles wickedly. “I can make do in a pinch.” She takes them out into the back garden and starts carving a pentacle into the ground with a stick.

You sure can! Upstairs you come across what looks like it might be [[Arabelle]]'s parent's room. She's told you to make yourself at home, and you find some thread and needles in the bedside drawer.

[[Arabelle]] putters around tidying the kitchen, the last of her visitors having retired for the night.
A black and brown tabby pushes up against her feet. "Hey Kasa" she bends down and ruffles the cat’s fur, "You be careful girl. A shadow haunts these people, and I don't know if they can see it."
She walks over and inspects the scorched mark left from the Taroka reading. A grim fortune, but these travellers seemed not to be bound by fate. They turned away from the path of the Wizard, and now the card belongs to them. She reaches for the deck – The Thief, Anarchist and the Horseman... she shudders.

Kasa's tail twitches as she watches [[Arabelle]]'s eyes cloud over.

*A vision forms of a small room, scattered with scrolls and arcane trinkets. A knight, clad in silver, and a Vistani woman, are both crouching down by an older man. He looks dazed, clutching an unmarked tome. The knight knocks the book from the man’s hands, wrapping it in cloth before picking it back up.

A raven is perched in the window, its beak wide with distress. The knight lifts the man, carrying him towards a tall mirror. She lights two sconces by the mirror’s side, and the reflection shifts, revealing a passage. They begin their escape.*


[19-Mar-22 10:56 PM] TenderstDM
*Meanwhile, the Vistani woman has drawn her rapier, and is now pacing the room in wait. An elvish man emerges from the stairway - the Devil’s servant. He sees the mirror passage and steps toward it, he has come with a single purpose. A flash of steel cuts across his face, and he turns to the woman, smiling back at him. There is no time for this. He unsheathes his sword, and with unsettling speed lunges forward.

His blows are swift and merciless, but the Vistani woman keeps a step ahead. He pulls down a bookcase, knocking her aside, allowing him to move once more towards the mirror. Before he can step through, the glass shatters. He turns to see the smoke trailing from the woman’s pistol. A twitch of anger crosses his face, he sighs and steps back across the broken shards.

They each circle the room, knowing now there is no other way for this to end. Together they move forward, and their blades meet again. The two dance back and forth, each step the difference between life and death. With her good leg, the woman kicks out, knocking her foe off balance. With a flurry of blows she manages to disarm the elf and holds her rapier to his neck.

The woman allows her breathing to slow, she goes to speak, but something isn’t right. She has defeated this man, but then why is she so afraid. Fear like she hasn’t felt in many years. A tingle moves up her spine and her hand trembles. It’s his eyes, his eyes are wrong, there is so much pain in them and she can’t bring herself to look away. Then the screaming starts. Hundreds of voices crying out. They fill the room, her ears ring, and then there is nothing but those agonising screams.*

The rapier falls to the ground, and [[Arabelle]] awakes. Kasa is there, nuzzling her face, and the kitchen slowly comes back into focus.

[20-Mar-22 12:46 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Fjdjfjdjfj NO SURELY NOT


[20-Mar-22 12:46 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
this must be a future yet to pass right?? Or something? 🥺


[20-Mar-22 12:57 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Once Varian hears [[Arabelle]]’s vision he asks “Do you have visions come to you often? I think the people you saw were [[Danton]], [[Ireena]] and Ezmeralda. We were meant to meet them at the tower by the lake, just East of here. Can you tell if this is a vision of the past, present or a premonition of the future?”


[30-Mar-22 07:49 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Magda is still casting Find Familiar outside, drawing her wee chalk circle and lighting the incense in her brazier. It flashes, and becomes a familiar large yellow snake.
“Hello, my dear,” she smiles. It rattles angrily and she picks a few owl feathers out of its neck. “Oh, I knowww, I’m sorry.”

(Thought I would get that out of the way 😂)

“I’m afraid I don’t know, but it’s been my experience that the truth usually takes the form you would least like it to…” [[Arabelle]] stares at the ground and shuffles her feet.

With a start, she looks back up, “That said, fate’s a funny thing!”

“I’ve been thinking too. I’m going to come with you when you head out for [[Berez]]. I know you’ve not been asked to go yet, but once you have, I’ll be there.”
She stands looking pleased with her decision for a moment, before turning about on the spot, “Now, time for breakfast! Who wants eggs? Nom nom, only the best from my hens.”

Can I add what Varian would have said?


[22-Apr-22 11:45 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
of course!!


[22-Apr-22 11:58 AM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
After Magda says she can't keep going with horses and chickens, Varian nods at her and says "We all have our trials to overcome. Hold on to what you believe in and you'll restore what is rightfully yours."


[22-Apr-22 12:02 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"I don't know what I believe anymore... I used to be so sure. Nowadays, it feels like everything's on the table. It'll all be so much easier once I've put a stake through that bastard's heart. It'll all be over..."


[22-Apr-22 12:03 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"I guess you're right. I can hold onto that. Thank you, friend."
