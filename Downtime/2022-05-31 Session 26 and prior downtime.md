Hey, uh @thenewdarling you've ticked off a spell slot for my lesser restoration right?


[21-Nov-21 10:50 AM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
right?


[21-Nov-21 10:51 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
S- sure I can have done that lmao


[21-Nov-21 10:52 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Wait are we at the point where I’m needing to cast it every day?

Do we not have any more beeswax and holy water?


[21-Nov-21 10:52 AM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
I'm out of salve til we get dem bones


[21-Nov-21 10:52 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Wait I’m like 90% sure a day hasn’t passed since I last did it


[21-Nov-21 10:53 AM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
bones make the church not desecrated, allows for holy water


[21-Nov-21 10:53 AM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
We had a long rest though


[21-Nov-21 10:53 AM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
so a day passed


[21-Nov-21 10:54 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
The long rest was the day we spent walking around the town etc etc, i definitely cast it on that day


[21-Nov-21 10:55 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Like we’re actually counting the amount of 24 Hour Periods in [[Strahd]], not just between long rests


[21-Nov-21 10:55 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
It’s getting late in the day but so long as I cast it on you tomorrow we should be fine


[21-Nov-21 10:55 AM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
I thought we needed to not cast to get the long rest


[21-Nov-21 10:56 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
If that’s the case you’re fucked XD cos if you need it every day and a long rest requires 24 hours without casting a spell


[21-Nov-21 10:56 AM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
Eh, we'll figure it out


[21-Nov-21 11:09 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
I’ll need to double-check, I don’t even think I put it in the session recap because I’m a FOOL


[21-Nov-21 11:09 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
I’ll start putting whether i cast it or not at the top of every session recap where I say what day it is


[21-Nov-21 01:39 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)

Magda hovers over the [[Lady Watcher]]’s body. “What do I do?” she asks the party. “I know what I want to do, what my blood is screaming for constantly, but I’ve learned to ignore it. So what’s the right thing to do? And why would he do this?”

[31-Dec-21 03:50 PM] Arlo de León (he/him)
“I think it would be wise to play Mr Strahds game for a while, until we’re ready to pay him back his dues”


[31-Dec-21 03:52 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
“We are rats on his operating table.” She rattles her fingers off the desk. “Normally my impulse right about now is to flip the table over completely. As it is, I don’t even know what that would look like…”


[31-Dec-21 03:52 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
“Why do I get the feeling this is the bait….. and there’s a hook coming?”


[31-Dec-21 03:55 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
“Exactly my thoughts. If [[Strahd]] has this kind of power over [[Sasha]], what’s to say he won’t have it over you once you drink [[Lady Watcher]]’s blood? Is this a risk we can take?”


[31-Dec-21 03:56 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
“But those are innocent people dying downstairs. Is [[Lady Watcher]]’s life worth more than theirs?”


[31-Dec-21 03:59 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
“I don’t see why he couldn’t just do that to me now though. [[Strahd]] is stronger than any vampire I’ve met and I’m barely subsisting on chickens.”


[31-Dec-21 03:59 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
“…. we couldn’t take her at our current skill level. It would folly to try…” She thinks about it. “Would it?”


[31-Dec-21 04:03 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
“Take [[Sasha]] out?” Varian looks at the party, noticing everyone’s wounds, “I don’t think we could.”


[31-Dec-21 04:06 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Magda looks around the room, at each of them in turn. “This is such a bad idea….” But she gets up.


[31-Dec-21 04:09 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
She leans over the [[Lady Watcher]]’s body, and whispers something in her ear.

||”I have not drank human blood in over half a century. I have tried to be good. But for you, you wicked hag, I will make an exception.”||

It is quick, and gory, and visceral. Bits of throat splatter across the table, arterial spray in a fountain, then down to a splutter. Magda stands, eyes like pinpricks, drenched in red.

She wipes her lips with the back of her hand, and then slurps the wipings. “How… quickly I forget,” she says to herself. She’s laughing. Breathless. She just stands in a moment in it, closing her eyes. The [[Lady Watcher]] crumbles into dust on the table. 

Magda opens her eyes. She’s looking at the party now. Like she’s still lost in the sauce. 

Like she’s still hungry.

She twitches, looks at the handkerchief, and grabs Arlo by the wrist. But it’s like when you have too much sugar at once and your muscles suddenly go weak, and it gives her a second to think. Her eyes return to normal. “Arlo.”


[31-Dec-21 04:15 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
She rips the handkerchief out of his hand. “That was very misguided of you.”

For a moment the church falls still, and then the catacomb’s door creaks open. At first a few townsfolk emerge, exhausted from their attempts to break the lock, and then the rest come. Battered and wounded, slowly they trickle out, a seemingly unending sea of broken faces. [[Father Lucian]] begins to guide people out into the street, cautiously at first, but it appears the city is quiet, apart from the sound of rain.

As the crowd thins, a bat escapes, flapping madly before taking off through a shattered window. And then the final figures emerge - **and the dice are rolled.**

[[Dargos]] Weerdo limps past, he manages to catch your eye and asks you to come see him before leaving town.

[[Alek]] is the last of the guards to come up, helping carry the wounded, “five dead he says… well, five in the catacombs, many more in the streets.”

[[Prince Rupert]] follows behind, cradling the body of [[Urwin]] Martikov. 
“One moment she was crying with her head in her hands, the next she came at us hungry and snarling. [[Father Lucian]] was a fool to take [[Sasha]] in, all vampires belong to their master… [[Urwin]] was barely back on his feet before he gave the last of his life, protecting the townsfolk down there”. 
The Dragonborn cannot cry, but the pain is clear in [[Prince Rupert]]’s eyes.

Nobody seems keen to stay inside for long, and soon you are alone in the broken hall. A faint blue glow emanates from an amulet in the ash where [[Fiona]]’s body lay, the same you saw her clutching before she was overcome by shadows.

[[Blinksy]] remains at the door, staring out. The church grounds are a mess of rubble and embers, no trace of the vampire spawn remains. In the dim light of the afternoon, the Eye of the [[Watcher manor]] gazes down over the town. Able townsfolk and the remaining guards tend to the wounded and start clearing the streets.

*In the direction of the [[Baron]]’s home, wisps of smoke can be seen in the distance.*

Varian gives Blinky’s shoulder a squeeze and smiles tentatively at him, “You did well, [[Blinksy]].”
Seeing the wisps of smoke in the distance, Varian curses under his breath, “[[Viktor]]!” and urges the party to come quickly.

(Just to add to this bit as I forgot to reply!) Arlo flinches when Magda grabs his wrist, but quickly recovers and levels her with an earnest look. “I wouldn’t have become who I am without dancing with darkness occasionally. You have that darkness, but also a lot of light. Life is about balance” he looks at Magdas blood drenched form, and then meets her eyes meaningfully, “and moderation”

As you approach the [[Baron]]’s manor, you can hear the fire hissing violently in the rain. The whole place is ablaze, and the front of the house has been completely blown to pieces. Nobody inside could still be alive.

As you stand staring, a hand reaches out touching your shoulder. You turn to see [[Viktor]], his mum and [[Stella]] beside him. [[Viktor]] falls forward, sobbing in your arms.
“Our home… our home is gone. And my father. My father is dead…”
[[Lydia]] Vallakovich looks to you all, “A guard came to warn us, [[Karl]] Watcher approached the manor, full of rage and madness. He tore the house apart with fireballs, with us inside. He meant for us to die.”
“But [[Viktor]] saved us!” [[Stella]] steps forward, taking hold of [[Viktor]]’s hand, “He did it. His circle worked and it transported us to the edge of town. Had you not healed him, we all would have perished.”

[[Stella]] shakes a little, and it seems the tremendous weight of the day falls upon each of you.
Something brushes past your legs, and you look down to see a familiar cat, its rightful mind finally returned.

If it passes the vibe check:


[10-Jan-22 04:01 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
While Magda is preparing the campfire, surreptitiously: "You're not looking well, Jeremiah. And I'm noticing that salve I keep making you is having less and less of an effect. How do you feel?"


[10-Jan-22 05:25 PM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
"What? No, it's working fine, I don't think Borovia agrees with me is all. I'm sure everyone feels the same."


[10-Jan-22 05:26 PM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
Jeremiah rolls out his bed and climbs in "Goodnight Magda"


[10-Jan-22 05:28 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Magda waits for Varian to go past before whispering into the bedroll. "Does Arlo look like he's wasting away? Does Varian? And there's..." She groans. "Listen, just trust me. I'm a cleric. I can sense something off with you. It's getting worse."


[10-Jan-22 05:36 PM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
"I'm just not as strong as them, you've all been going out adventuring for years, I've been mopping floors all my life" He turns over in his bed roll. "How do you even know what I'm supposed to be like? Have you ever even met another half-goblin?"


[10-Jan-22 05:39 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"If I'm going to be honest with you, I didn't know they existed until I met you." She takes a deep breath. "Ninth Circle, you're going to make me say it." She makes sure no-one is listening.


[10-Jan-22 05:41 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"Jeremiah, I can see people's heartbeats. I can hear their blood pounding. Ever since [[Lady Watcher]], I have to keep reminding myself that you're all still people, that you're not just bags of blood to drain. Even my friends." She looks up at Arlo and Varian across the campsite. "But not you. There's something wrong with your blood, I can smell it. Like you'd give me food poisoning. And it's getting worse."


[10-Jan-22 05:43 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"You can't keep pretending it's not happening. I've seen it before. Someone buries their head in the sand until they're growing fangs. I don't want to kill you Jeremiah. We have to deal with this."


[10-Jan-22 05:46 PM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
"What do you expect me to do Magda? We're already going to Kresk, do you want me to lie awake at night worrying? I've followed every lead as best I can, the only thing I could have done better was to abandon the bonegrinder and Vallaki"


[10-Jan-22 05:49 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"No-one except you knows how bad it's getting. And you just tried to tell me it was just because you were tired. Our current plan is to stop on the way to Kresk. Because you won't communicate. Should we bypass the tower and head straight to Kresk?" She shrugs. "I have no idea. Because you won't talk about it."


[10-Jan-22 05:54 PM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
"Frankly, I was telling the truth then, but you know, rotting blood and all that changed my mind. Let's talk about it in the morning, you're not getting me to stay up through your shift that easily" He manages a slight smile then turns back over


[10-Jan-22 05:58 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
She smiles. "Sure. You watch out for me, I'll watch out for you. Us infected have to stick together." She stirs the fire, and looks over to the others just going to bed. Watching their pulses slow in the dark as they relax. As they let their guards down. She pauses... and then shakes herself to remind her of who she is, and what she isn't.

While we're climbing the hill alongside the horses, Magda says to @varian : "You know, that's two of my lives I owe you now. I'm racking up quite the debt."


[17-Jan-22 12:17 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian, although looking exhausted, seems to have a spring in his step, a sparkle in his eyes. He looks at Magda and smiles.
"I believe you have saved mine at least twice by now. If you are wanting to keep tabs, I'd say we're even."
He looks into the middle distance, fidgeting with his ring for a second.
"Plus, you have aided me in recovering and protecting something much more valuable than my physical health."


[17-Jan-22 12:21 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"Ah! The child." She snorts. "Tell me, is she settling back into her jewellery nicely? On an entirely selfish level, I'm glad to have her wandering around helping us. We'll certainly need all the help we can get."


[17-Jan-22 12:24 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
"As eager as she is to help, I... don't want her to be hurt again."


[17-Jan-22 12:28 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian's smile wanes.
"Having been taken hostage by [[hags]] and imprisoned in the body of a hellhound doesn't seem to have been excitement enough for her."
His tone suggests he's said this before, more than once.


[17-Jan-22 12:36 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"Well. I expect if it was peace she wanted, she would have chosen to move on, and obey the natural order." Magda claps Varian on the shoulder. "It seems your little one has chosen violence."


[17-Jan-22 12:36 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"I can't say I don't understand her point of view. If I wanted to die on the road like that thief back there, I could've done it 200 years ago. But it seems you'll always be there to pull her out of trouble, just like you did with me with the [[hags]]."


[17-Jan-22 12:42 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
"When [[Rose]] asked me to take her with me, I didn't expect her to be choosing violence over peace. She had enough of it growing up..."
He looks concerned at your remark, almost sad while saying this.


[17-Jan-22 12:51 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
"Her curiosity and wonder of the world is all I wish for her to keep experiencing. But I'm afraid you're right. My own life is permeated by violence. How would I be able to keep her from it? And if she chose to come with me, maybe she knew that all along."


[17-Jan-22 01:56 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"You seem so desperate for her to find peace, and yet... you want none of it for yourself. If you chose to go live on a farm like that irritating little girl, [[Rose]] would go with you. You would never want for anything. You would spend your days watching the sun rise and fall, never impacting anything, never being impacted by anything else. .... Frankly, I can't imagine a worse form of torture."


[17-Jan-22 01:58 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"I sense a great torment in you, Varian. You have something out there you need to do. I would like to help you do it, as your friend. But it's your decision. And [[Rose]] follows you. She would follow you into hell. In fact -- she already did. And she followed you back out again."


[17-Jan-22 04:51 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian chuckles.
"I believe peace might start with freedom. And, for as long as I can remember, I've been bound to forces too powerful for me to ran away from. First, it was my family. They worked very hard to find the right skill set that would make me useful, and trained me well in it. If for nothing else, I am grateful to them for that. But the Drow are not concerned with peace.
And, when I thought I would finally be able to find some freedom, I was taken here.”

[17-Jan-22 04:56 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
“Maybe I could have found peace in Barovia. My family wouldn’t be able to find me and I would be free to carve my own path. 
But old dreams still clung to me. To survive in the wilds of the Underdark, one must not delay when the Spider Queen bestows her gifts. For with even the slightest hesitation, the briefest moment of doubt, she will snatch back her blessing, depriving her chosen of the wonders of her favour. And I’d waited for her favour for so long.”


[17-Jan-22 05:01 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
“I sold my soul for power and am now bound to a new force, and one much harder to ran from."


[17-Jan-22 05:01 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Magda thinks of the battlefield, sparkling with Lolth's Fire. "What price will you pay for that favour? What cost would it extract?"


[17-Jan-22 05:07 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
"Servitude and loyalty."


[17-Jan-22 05:15 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"I thought I knew you better than that, Varian. We are in the arsehole of the planar system. We can serve no-one but ourselves if we want to get out alive." She stops. "Lolth... A dark queen of the gods. A dangerous thing. The gods and monsters I've met, all men. Scheming men, lying men, but... in the end, simple. Stupid. A matriarch... she must be truly terrifying. But you can tell her you already have a queen." She scratches behind her horse's ears. "Isn't that right, Icarus?"

[17-Jan-22 05:28 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
She looks at Varian over her shoulder. "Do you want her favour? Would it bring you joy?"


[17-Jan-22 05:32 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian chuckles and his eyes twinkle impishly.
"I am sorry to add to the stack of stupid men you've met.  
No, Lolth will bring me no joy. Lolth watches, Lolth tests and, above all, Lolth consumes. I don’t know what Her plans are, but at least for now our goals are aligned.”


[17-Jan-22 05:36 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
She shrugs. "It's just your nature. Though, you are neither a god nor a monster." She looks at his red eyes. "That I know of."


[17-Jan-22 05:39 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"When you find that Lolth's goals do not align with your own anymore, let me know. Whatever your Spider Queen wants with you here, it cannot be good."


[17-Jan-22 05:54 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian looks warily at Magda.
“No, I don’t think it will be. And She will discard me as easily as She did [[Izek]]. Or try.”


[17-Jan-22 05:57 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"Oh!" Magda blinks. "Well in that case, you're fine. Unless you plan on chaining yourself to a wall and stabbing yourself in the neck."

Ah I see! I think I’m starting to get the game now!


[17-Jan-22 08:32 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian rolls his eyes and looks back at Magda.
“You remind me of my people. Males are merely tolerated, useful primarily for physical and skilled labour, and breeding purposes.”


[17-Jan-22 08:35 PM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
"You breed Porpoises Varian?"

"Oh, you misunderstand me, Varian. I love men. I've just learned not to expect them to put their egos second."


[17-Jan-22 08:43 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"They look at you like an object even as you've cut down their armies. They whine and whine about their honour while stabbing each other in the back. They talk over you, they talk down to you...." She shrugs. "But it doesn't mean I hate them on principle."


[17-Jan-22 08:50 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian looks shocked! “A man would dare talk over you?”


[17-Jan-22 08:51 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
“Surface dwellers are even stranger than what we were told.”

Magda puts the pieces together. "Ah. Of course. The drow matriarchy."


[17-Jan-22 08:55 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"It's funny you mention it actually. Barovia has been... more egalitarian than most of the places I've spent my life. But believe me when I tell you, in my 250 years, I have..."


[17-Jan-22 08:55 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
She sighs like she doesn't even have the energy to put it into words.


[17-Jan-22 08:56 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"Trust me. Most men on the surface think your brain is going to overheat at any moment, it's exhausting."


[17-Jan-22 08:57 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
She smiles at Jeremiah, changing the subject. "You were saying about porpoises, darling."

(Can I have Magda gather the materials for Find Familiar in the wee house?)


[10-Mar-22 04:36 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
like if [[Arabelle]] would have them lying around


[19-Mar-22 03:21 PM] TenderstDM
Absolutely, sorry I didn't see this!


[19-Mar-22 03:21 PM] TenderstDM
What is it you're looking for?


[19-Mar-22 03:23 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
10gp worth of charcoal, incense, and herbs


[19-Mar-22 03:23 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
;D


[19-Mar-22 03:55 PM] TenderstDM
[[Arabelle]] drags a stool over by the kitchen table, she hops up and starts rummaging around the top shelves. She comes back down with a few sage leaves and then scoops some charcoal out from the back of the stove. For a moment it looks as if she's forgotten something, before she reaches into her apron pocket, pulling out a handful of little incense cones.
"That do you?"


[19-Mar-22 09:06 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Magda smiles wickedly. “I can make do in a pinch.” She takes them out into the back garden and starts carving a pentacle into the ground with a stick.

You sure can! Upstairs you come across what looks like it might be [[Arabelle]]'s parent's room. She's told you to make yourself at home, and you find some thread and needles in the bedside drawer.


[19-Mar-22 10:55 PM] TenderstDM
***

[[Arabelle]] putters around tidying the kitchen, the last of her visitors having retired for the night.
A black and brown tabby pushes up against her feet. "Hey Kasa" she bends down and ruffles the cat’s fur, "You be careful girl. A shadow haunts these people, and I don't know if they can see it."
She walks over and inspects the scorched mark left from the Taroka reading. A grim fortune, but these travellers seemed not to be bound by fate. They turned away from the path of the Wizard, and now the card belongs to them. She reaches for the deck – The Thief, Anarchist and the Horseman... she shudders.

Kasa's tail twitches as she watches [[Arabelle]]'s eyes cloud over.


[19-Mar-22 10:56 PM] TenderstDM
*A vision forms of a small room, scattered with scrolls and arcane trinkets. A knight, clad in silver, and a Vistani woman, are both crouching down by an older man. He looks dazed, clutching an unmarked tome. The knight knocks the book from the man’s hands, wrapping it in cloth before picking it back up.

A raven is perched in the window, its beak wide with distress. The knight lifts the man, carrying him towards a tall mirror. She lights two sconces by the mirror’s side, and the reflection shifts, revealing a passage. They begin their escape.*


[19-Mar-22 10:56 PM] TenderstDM
*Meanwhile, the Vistani woman has drawn her rapier, and is now pacing the room in wait. An elvish man emerges from the stairway - the Devil’s servant. He sees the mirror passage and steps toward it, he has come with a single purpose. A flash of steel cuts across his face, and he turns to the woman, smiling back at him. There is no time for this. He unsheathes his sword, and with unsettling speed lunges forward.

His blows are swift and merciless, but the Vistani woman keeps a step ahead. He pulls down a bookcase, knocking her aside, allowing him to move once more towards the mirror. Before he can step through, the glass shatters. He turns to see the smoke trailing from the woman’s pistol. A twitch of anger crosses his face, he sighs and steps back across the broken shards.

They each circle the room, knowing now there is no other way for this to end. Together they move forward, and their blades meet again. The two dance back and forth, each step the difference between life and death. With her good leg, the woman kicks out, knocking her foe off balance. With a flurry of blows she manages to disarm the elf and holds her rapier to his neck.

The woman allows her breathing to slow, she goes to speak, but something isn’t right. She has defeated this man, but then why is she so afraid. Fear like she hasn’t felt in many years. A tingle moves up her spine and her hand trembles. It’s his eyes, his eyes are wrong, there is so much pain in them and she can’t bring herself to look away. Then the screaming starts. Hundreds of voices crying out. They fill the room, her ears ring, and then there is nothing but those agonising screams.*

The rapier falls to the ground, and [[Arabelle]] awakes. Kasa is there, nuzzling her face, and the kitchen slowly comes back into focus.

[[Danton]] is dead/dying… what a mess


[20-Mar-22 12:46 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Fjdjfjdjfj NO SURELY NOT


[20-Mar-22 12:46 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
this must be a future yet to pass right?? Or something? 🥺


[20-Mar-22 12:57 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Once Varian hears [[Arabelle]]’s vision he asks “Do you have visions come to you often? I think the people you saw were [[Danton]], [[Ireena]] and Ezmeralda. We were meant to meet them at the tower by the lake, just East of here. Can you tell if this is a vision of the past, present or a premonition of the future?”


[30-Mar-22 07:49 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Magda is still casting Find Familiar outside, drawing her wee chalk circle and lighting the incense in her brazier. It flashes, and becomes a familiar large yellow snake.
“Hello, my dear,” she smiles. It rattles angrily and she picks a few owl feathers out of its neck. “Oh, I knowww, I’m sorry.”

“I’m afraid I don’t know, but it’s been my experience that the truth usually takes the form you would least like it to…” [[Arabelle]] stares at the ground and shuffles her feet.

With a start, she looks back up, “That said, fate’s a funny thing!”

“I’ve been thinking too. I’m going to come with you when you head out for [[Berez]]. I know you’ve not been asked to go yet, but once you have, I’ll be there.”
She stands looking pleased with her decision for a moment, before turning about on the spot, “Now, time for breakfast! Who wants eggs? Nom nom, only the best from my hens.”

[22-Apr-22 11:45 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
of course!!


[22-Apr-22 11:58 AM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
After Magda says she can't keep going with horses and chickens, Varian nods at her and says "We all have our trials to overcome. Hold on to what you believe in and you'll restore what is rightfully yours."


[22-Apr-22 12:02 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"I don't know what I believe anymore... I used to be so sure. Nowadays, it feels like everything's on the table. It'll all be so much easier once I've put a stake through that bastard's heart. It'll all be over..."


[22-Apr-22 12:03 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"I guess you're right. I can hold onto that. Thank you, friend."
