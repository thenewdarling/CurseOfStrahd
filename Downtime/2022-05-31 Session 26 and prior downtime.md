If it passes the vibe check:


[10-Jan-22 04:01 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
While Magda is preparing the campfire, surreptitiously: "You're not looking well, Jeremiah. And I'm noticing that salve I keep making you is having less and less of an effect. How do you feel?"


[10-Jan-22 05:25 PM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
"What? No, it's working fine, I don't think Borovia agrees with me is all. I'm sure everyone feels the same."


[10-Jan-22 05:26 PM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
Jeremiah rolls out his bed and climbs in "Goodnight Magda"


[10-Jan-22 05:28 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Magda waits for Varian to go past before whispering into the bedroll. "Does Arlo look like he's wasting away? Does Varian? And there's..." She groans. "Listen, just trust me. I'm a cleric. I can sense something off with you. It's getting worse."


[10-Jan-22 05:36 PM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
"I'm just not as strong as them, you've all been going out adventuring for years, I've been mopping floors all my life" He turns over in his bed roll. "How do you even know what I'm supposed to be like? Have you ever even met another half-goblin?"


[10-Jan-22 05:39 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"If I'm going to be honest with you, I didn't know they existed until I met you." She takes a deep breath. "Ninth Circle, you're going to make me say it." She makes sure no-one is listening.


[10-Jan-22 05:41 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"Jeremiah, I can see people's heartbeats. I can hear their blood pounding. Ever since [[Lady Watcher]], I have to keep reminding myself that you're all still people, that you're not just bags of blood to drain. Even my friends." She looks up at Arlo and Varian across the campsite. "But not you. There's something wrong with your blood, I can smell it. Like you'd give me food poisoning. And it's getting worse."


[10-Jan-22 05:43 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"You can't keep pretending it's not happening. I've seen it before. Someone buries their head in the sand until they're growing fangs. I don't want to kill you Jeremiah. We have to deal with this."


[10-Jan-22 05:46 PM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
"What do you expect me to do Magda? We're already going to Kresk, do you want me to lie awake at night worrying? I've followed every lead as best I can, the only thing I could have done better was to abandon the bonegrinder and Vallaki"


[10-Jan-22 05:49 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"No-one except you knows how bad it's getting. And you just tried to tell me it was just because you were tired. Our current plan is to stop on the way to Kresk. Because you won't communicate. Should we bypass the tower and head straight to Kresk?" She shrugs. "I have no idea. Because you won't talk about it."


[10-Jan-22 05:54 PM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
"Frankly, I was telling the truth then, but you know, rotting blood and all that changed my mind. Let's talk about it in the morning, you're not getting me to stay up through your shift that easily" He manages a slight smile then turns back over


[10-Jan-22 05:58 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
She smiles. "Sure. You watch out for me, I'll watch out for you. Us infected have to stick together." She stirs the fire, and looks over to the others just going to bed. Watching their pulses slow in the dark as they relax. As they let their guards down. She pauses... and then shakes herself to remind her of who she is, and what she isn't.

[17-Jan-22 11:12 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
While we're climbing the hill alongside the horses, Magda says to @varian : "You know, that's two of my lives I owe you now. I'm racking up quite the debt."


[17-Jan-22 12:17 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian, although looking exhausted, seems to have a spring in his step, a sparkle in his eyes. He looks at Magda and smiles.
"I believe you have saved mine at least twice by now. If you are wanting to keep tabs, I'd say we're even."
He looks into the middle distance, fidgeting with his ring for a second.
"Plus, you have aided me in recovering and protecting something much more valuable than my physical health."


[17-Jan-22 12:21 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"Ah! The child." She snorts. "Tell me, is she settling back into her jewellery nicely? On an entirely selfish level, I'm glad to have her wandering around helping us. We'll certainly need all the help we can get."


[17-Jan-22 12:24 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
"As eager as she is to help, I... don't want her to be hurt again."


[17-Jan-22 12:28 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian's smile wanes.
"Having been taken hostage by [[hags]] and imprisoned in the body of a hellhound doesn't seem to have been excitement enough for her."
His tone suggests he's said this before, more than once.


[17-Jan-22 12:36 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"Well. I expect if it was peace she wanted, she would have chosen to move on, and obey the natural order." Magda claps Varian on the shoulder. "It seems your little one has chosen violence."


[17-Jan-22 12:36 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"I can't say I don't understand her point of view. If I wanted to die on the road like that thief back there, I could've done it 200 years ago. But it seems you'll always be there to pull her out of trouble, just like you did with me with the [[hags]]."


[17-Jan-22 12:42 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
"When [[Rose]] asked me to take her with me, I didn't expect her to be choosing violence over peace. She had enough of it growing up..."
He looks concerned at your remark, almost sad while saying this.


[17-Jan-22 12:51 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
"Her curiosity and wonder of the world is all I wish for her to keep experiencing. But I'm afraid you're right. My own life is permeated by violence. How would I be able to keep her from it? And if she chose to come with me, maybe she knew that all along."


[17-Jan-22 01:56 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"You seem so desperate for her to find peace, and yet... you want none of it for yourself. If you chose to go live on a farm like that irritating little girl, [[Rose]] would go with you. You would never want for anything. You would spend your days watching the sun rise and fall, never impacting anything, never being impacted by anything else. .... Frankly, I can't imagine a worse form of torture."


[17-Jan-22 01:58 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"I sense a great torment in you, Varian. You have something out there you need to do. I would like to help you do it, as your friend. But it's your decision. And [[Rose]] follows you. She would follow you into hell. In fact -- she already did. And she followed you back out again."


[17-Jan-22 04:51 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian chuckles.
"I believe peace might start with freedom. And, for as long as I can remember, I've been bound to forces too powerful for me to ran away from. First, it was my family. They worked very hard to find the right skill set that would make me useful, and trained me well in it. If for nothing else, I am grateful to them for that. But the Drow are not concerned with peace.
And, when I thought I would finally be able to find some freedom, I was taken here.‚Äù

[17-Jan-22 04:56 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
‚ÄúMaybe I could have found peace in Barovia. My family wouldn‚Äôt be able to find me and I would be free to carve my own path. 
But old dreams still clung to me. To survive in the wilds of the Underdark, one must not delay when the Spider Queen bestows her gifts. For with even the slightest hesitation, the briefest moment of doubt, she will snatch back her blessing, depriving her chosen of the wonders of her favour. And I‚Äôd waited for her favour for so long.‚Äù


[17-Jan-22 05:01 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
‚ÄúI sold my soul for power and am now bound to a new force, and one much harder to ran from."


[17-Jan-22 05:01 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Magda thinks of the battlefield, sparkling with Lolth's Fire. "What price will you pay for that favour? What cost would it extract?"


[17-Jan-22 05:07 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
"Servitude and loyalty."


[17-Jan-22 05:15 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"I thought I knew you better than that, Varian. We are in the arsehole of the planar system. We can serve no-one but ourselves if we want to get out alive." She stops. "Lolth... A dark queen of the gods. A dangerous thing. The gods and monsters I've met, all men. Scheming men, lying men, but... in the end, simple. Stupid. A matriarch... she must be truly terrifying. But you can tell her you already have a queen." She scratches behind her horse's ears. "Isn't that right, Icarus?"


[17-Jan-22 05:15 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
üê¥: *pfpfpf*


[17-Jan-22 05:28 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
She looks at Varian over her shoulder. "Do you want her favour? Would it bring you joy?"


[17-Jan-22 05:32 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian chuckles and his eyes twinkle impishly.
"I am sorry to add to the stack of stupid men you've met.  
No, Lolth will bring me no joy. Lolth watches, Lolth tests and, above all, Lolth consumes. I don‚Äôt know what Her plans are, but at least for now our goals are aligned.‚Äù


[17-Jan-22 05:36 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
She shrugs. "It's just your nature. Though, you are neither a god nor a monster." She looks at his red eyes. "That I know of."


[17-Jan-22 05:39 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"When you find that Lolth's goals do not align with your own anymore, let me know. Whatever your Spider Queen wants with you here, it cannot be good."


[17-Jan-22 05:54 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian looks warily at Magda.
‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt think it will be. And She will discard me as easily as She did [[Izek]]. Or try.‚Äù


[17-Jan-22 05:57 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"Oh!" Magda blinks. "Well in that case, you're fine. Unless you plan on chaining yourself to a wall and stabbing yourself in the neck."

Varian laughs. "I wouldn't want to make it easier to whoever She recruits next."


[17-Jan-22 06:14 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"If we see any other drow with red eyes, I'll be on the lookout." She looks over her shoulder at Jeremiah and Arlo talking quietly in the back. ".... what do you think they talk about?" she says quietly.


[17-Jan-22 06:30 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian looks back and shrugs. "I wouldn't have a clue. Do you?"

Varian rolls his eyes and looks back at Magda.
‚ÄúYou remind me of my people. Males are merely tolerated, useful primarily for physical and skilled labour, and breeding purposes.‚Äù

"You breed Porpoises Varian?"

"They look at you like an object even as you've cut down their armies. They whine and whine about their honour while stabbing each other in the back. They talk over you, they talk down to you...." She shrugs. "But it doesn't mean I hate them on principle."


[17-Jan-22 08:50 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian looks shocked! ‚ÄúA man would dare talk over you?‚Äù

"It's funny you mention it actually. Barovia has been... more egalitarian than most of the places I've spent my life. But believe me when I tell you, in my 250 years, I have..."

She sighs like she doesn't even have the energy to put it into words.

"Trust me. Most men on the surface think your brain is going to overheat at any moment, it's exhausting."

[19-Mar-22 03:55 PM] TenderstDM
[[Arabelle]] drags a stool over by the kitchen table, she hops up and starts rummaging around the top shelves. She comes back down with a few sage leaves and then scoops some charcoal out from the back of the stove. For a moment it looks as if she's forgotten something, before she reaches into her apron pocket, pulling out a handful of little incense cones.
"That do you?"


[19-Mar-22 09:06 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Magda smiles wickedly. ‚ÄúI can make do in a pinch.‚Äù She takes them out into the back garden and starts carving a pentacle into the ground with a stick.

You sure can! Upstairs you come across what looks like it might be [[Arabelle]]'s parent's room. She's told you to make yourself at home, and you find some thread and needles in the bedside drawer.


[19-Mar-22 10:55 PM] TenderstDM
***

[[Arabelle]] putters around tidying the kitchen, the last of her visitors having retired for the night.
A black and brown tabby pushes up against her feet. "Hey Kasa" she bends down and ruffles the cat‚Äôs fur, "You be careful girl. A shadow haunts these people, and I don't know if they can see it."
She walks over and inspects the scorched mark left from the Taroka reading. A grim fortune, but these travellers seemed not to be bound by fate. They turned away from the path of the Wizard, and now the card belongs to them. She reaches for the deck ‚Äì The Thief, Anarchist and the Horseman... she shudders.

Kasa's tail twitches as she watches [[Arabelle]]'s eyes cloud over.


[19-Mar-22 10:56 PM] TenderstDM
*A vision forms of a small room, scattered with scrolls and arcane trinkets. A knight, clad in silver, and a Vistani woman, are both crouching down by an older man. He looks dazed, clutching an unmarked tome. The knight knocks the book from the man‚Äôs hands, wrapping it in cloth before picking it back up.

A raven is perched in the window, its beak wide with distress. The knight lifts the man, carrying him towards a tall mirror. She lights two sconces by the mirror‚Äôs side, and the reflection shifts, revealing a passage. They begin their escape.*


[19-Mar-22 10:56 PM] TenderstDM
*Meanwhile, the Vistani woman has drawn her rapier, and is now pacing the room in wait. An elvish man emerges from the stairway - the Devil‚Äôs servant. He sees the mirror passage and steps toward it, he has come with a single purpose. A flash of steel cuts across his face, and he turns to the woman, smiling back at him. There is no time for this. He unsheathes his sword, and with unsettling speed lunges forward.

His blows are swift and merciless, but the Vistani woman keeps a step ahead. He pulls down a bookcase, knocking her aside, allowing him to move once more towards the mirror. Before he can step through, the glass shatters. He turns to see the smoke trailing from the woman‚Äôs pistol. A twitch of anger crosses his face, he sighs and steps back across the broken shards.

They each circle the room, knowing now there is no other way for this to end. Together they move forward, and their blades meet again. The two dance back and forth, each step the difference between life and death. With her good leg, the woman kicks out, knocking her foe off balance. With a flurry of blows she manages to disarm the elf and holds her rapier to his neck.

The woman allows her breathing to slow, she goes to speak, but something isn‚Äôt right. She has defeated this man, but then why is she so afraid. Fear like she hasn‚Äôt felt in many years. A tingle moves up her spine and her hand trembles. It‚Äôs his eyes, his eyes are wrong, there is so much pain in them and she can‚Äôt bring herself to look away. Then the screaming starts. Hundreds of voices crying out. They fill the room, her ears ring, and then there is nothing but those agonising screams.*

The rapier falls to the ground, and [[Arabelle]] awakes. Kasa is there, nuzzling her face, and the kitchen slowly comes back into focus.

Once Varian hears [[Arabelle]]‚Äôs vision he asks ‚ÄúDo you have visions come to you often? I think the people you saw were [[Danton]], [[Ireena]] and Ezmeralda. We were meant to meet them at the tower by the lake, just East of here. Can you tell if this is a vision of the past, present or a premonition of the future?‚Äù


[30-Mar-22 07:49 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Magda is still casting Find Familiar outside, drawing her wee chalk circle and lighting the incense in her brazier. It flashes, and becomes a familiar large yellow snake.
‚ÄúHello, my dear,‚Äù she smiles. It rattles angrily and she picks a few owl feathers out of its neck. ‚ÄúOh, I knowww, I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

"I don't know what I believe anymore... I used to be so sure. Nowadays, it feels like everything's on the table. It'll all be so much easier once I've put a stake through that bastard's heart. It'll all be over..."
