After Magda says she can't keep going with horses and chickens, Varian nods at her and says "We all have our trials to overcome. Hold on to what you believe in and you'll restore what is rightfully yours."

"I don't know what I believe anymore... I used to be so sure. Nowadays, it feels like everything's on the table. It'll all be so much easier once I've put a stake through that bastard's heart. It'll all be over..."

"I guess you're right. I can hold onto that. Thank you, friend."
