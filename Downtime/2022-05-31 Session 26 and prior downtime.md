Oo @Liam I doubt this camp has like a mobile blacksmith, but would there be anyone selling weapons? 👀


[31-May-21 09:05 AM] TenderstDM
Nobody in particular, but there would likely be people around willing to trade things! Feel free to ask around for stuff


[31-May-21 09:05 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
I think I’ll wander about, asking around about a rapier 👀


[31-May-21 09:25 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
oo also diamonds!!! When we next level up I'm gonna be expected to bring folk back from the dead lol


[01-Jun-21 02:08 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
After failing to get his lock of hair back from Radu and the enigmatic readings of Madame Eva, Varian feels frustrated and trapped. Rose, now a constant voice in his mind prompting him to go and live a little, encourages him to rest and make the most out of this time, which to him means one thing only - gather as much intel as possible. With Rose as a second pair of eyes, Varian explores the camp and tries to talk with people.
The first and most obvious piece of information he is looking for is  on the wondering Vistani the cards told us to look for. What is her name, who is the mentor she looks for, if anyone has an idea on how to find her.
Secondly, if someone has any knowledge of a wizard’s tower on a lake, and any history associated to it.
Thirdly, he looks for any advice on surviving this new landscape. What herbs, berries, wildlife to avoid and what could be helpful.
And finally, if people have ever seen a ghostly knight on a horse roaming around, or if there are legends of one.

Just one more detail I'd like to add to my downtime meanders:
As Varian explores the Vistani camp, he spots Radu. Still bitter about him rigging the game, he sends Rose, in her invisible form, to spy on him for a couple of games and see if she can tell how Radu tricks people. After that, once Radu retires for the night, she'll follow him and try to find out where he'd keep Varian's and Magda's hair strands.

I think I may have asked this yesterday lmao


[01-Jun-21 09:07 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
If time is no issue, I will make a point of preparing a balm to cast Lesser Restoration on the moment my spells slots come back


[02-Jun-21 01:05 PM] TenderstDM
The morning after Madame Eva’s reading, Varian and Jeremiah awake with an extra hit dice of temporary hit points (as these are acquired during your long rest, they will carry into the following days). Ireena introduces the group to Arlo, and explains that her prophecy from Madame Eva’s, includes the four of you. As such Ireena wants you to prepare yourself as best you can. “Go acquire whatever you may need to travel, it is three days ride to Vallaki, and the roads in Barovia are always treacherous.” She hands each of you 25gp.


[02-Jun-21 01:05 PM] TenderstDM
@thenewdarling  Nobody in the camp knows of where you might acquire a diamond outside of Vallaki, thankfully this is where you are heading. Although most of the Vistani carry arms, it takes you a while to find someone willing to trade a rapier. A young woman has recently acquired some wares, she has a silvered rapier and dagger, worth 40gp and 25gp to her respectively – or an item of suitable worth to trade!


[02-Jun-21 01:14 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
(Magda makes sure to say hello to Arlo before going to the young woman - presumably quite business-like about the whole thing)


[02-Jun-21 01:16 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Valuing her shortsword at 15gp, she offers to trade both it and the 25gp from Madame Eva for the silvered rapier


[02-Jun-21 01:26 PM] pettypierrot#6397
Arlo greets everyone cheerfully, with a bow. He’s still not entirely clicked that here’s stuck here, and is enjoying the ambiance. He seeks someone out to tell him about the Vistani and Boravia in general

[02-Jun-21 01:57 PM] TenderstDM
She's happy to receive your interest, but has no need for your sword. She stumbled into these items, maybe if you offered to take both the dagger and rapier of her hands she could do you a deal?


[02-Jun-21 02:05 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"I'd be happy to, but I don't have much more to offer unfortunately. I have 32gp to my name, and if other weapons are not your fancy, what did you have in mind?"


[02-Jun-21 02:22 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
(If anyone else is nearby who's interested in the dagger:) "Perhaps we could pool our resources? I don't know if any of you are particularly interested in this butter knife - shiny though it may be. Hm, I suppose it could cleave a zombie skull if thrown hard enough. It is tipped with silver, after all."

[02-Jun-21 04:14 PM] TenderstDM
It is! They're both pretty ornate, the dagger has a small red gem stone embedded in its handle and the rapier has an intricate gold hand guard


[03-Jun-21 08:07 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Btw! I would like to make sure we get like an evening wine or something during the downtime day so we can have like, interaction with Arlo before the next session starts


[05-Jun-21 01:21 PM] TenderstDM
“I could do you them both for 50gp! Else you have something suitably exciting to keep the wee ones entertained, they’re always asking for one of those Blinksy dolls from town!”


[05-Jun-21 01:22 PM] TenderstDM
@UsernameOfRassilon @thenewdarling Father Rurick’s note shows a slightly more complicated process than he let on, perhaps mundane to him now after years of practice. At least there is no indication expiration will be an issue…
The salve requires: bee’s wax + water taken from holy ground + 4 hours downtime to imbue with minor restoration (DC12 WIS check for success). Multiple batches can be attempted at a time.

A Vistani cleric is willing to sell holy water for 5gp, enough for three batches. He believes the only one capable of a more permanent cure would be the abbot at Krezk.

@UsernameOfRassilon  Asking around you find the Vistani people do have a little magic in their blood. An animal friendship spell is widely known, and teachable to friendly strangers that know how to dance. Some of the camp elders know how to bestow curses upon less friendly travellers - it would take a great gesture of trust before they’d consider teaching this to an outsider.


[05-Jun-21 01:25 PM] TenderstDM
@varian  @arlo  In search of details about your strange surroundings, you find yourself directed towards the camp elders. From them you find,
-    The Vistani people have always called Barovia their home, their ancestors once helped Strahd when he was still human, lost and injured in their valley. It is for this past kindness that he offers the Vistani temporary leave from the mists. Their deal now is for protection, and in return they draw more souls to Barovia.
-    The Martikov family are worth seeking out in Vallaki, they are good people. The mayor on the other hand is an unhinged man, his best intentions twisted by fear. There is a great deal of unrest in the city.
-    Avoid the wildlife, period. The zombies in Barovia are infused with a greater evil than those created by traditional necromancy, this is the work of the witches in Berez to the south.
-    If you’re on the lookout for poisons, Corpse Flowers grow down by the water, the kids know not to touch them. "Poison is the least of our worries these days though, many children have gone missing over the last month. Distressingly there are many possible culprits, a small hunting party is out investigating the cause, they were due back yesterday…"

[05-Jun-21 11:12 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian tries to find out more about the missing children. Who are the other possible culprits? Where did the hunting party leave for? Wouldn’t it be in Strahd’s best interest to keep the children safe, even if only for keeping those who leave Barovia liable to come back? So does he offer any help?

[10-Jun-21 08:16 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian goes looking for Magda, Jeremiah, Arlo and Ireena.
"I have some information I need to share with you. There seems to be a serious threat to the Vistani people south of this camp. Their children have started to go missing, and like the elders said, they've sent a small hunting party to investigate this, but they have not returned. I've met one of the missing children's mother and she believes the culprits are night hags. She mentioned a windmill and a place called Berez. We need to help them!"


[10-Jun-21 08:20 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
To Ireena Varian says:
"I know you are in a rush to part to Vallaki and find Van Richten, but these people need our help and there is so much information here we could get to help us in our mutual goal. Help me find these missing children and then maybe the Vistani people will help us even further."


[10-Jun-21 08:21 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
To Magda, Jeremiah and Arlo Varian says:
"I truely believe it will be in our best interests to help these children. Will you come with me? And if so, we should prepare ourselves for the worst."


[10-Jun-21 10:30 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
“I’m noticing a theme, Varian. A small child bats its eyes at you and your heart melts like an ice cream. 😒 However, you did save my life, and I’m not one to leave a debt unpaid. I’ll help you. Ireena, please don’t leave without us — this shouldn’t take too long if we all put our steel to it.”


[11-Jun-21 08:14 AM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian flinches at that remark and glares at Magda for a split second.

“Surely you can see this goes beyond helping a child. It is to my understanding that they are already dead, so I would say it’s not so much about the children as it is about gaining the Vistani’s respect. There is so much more we need to learn from them. Have you even tried learning more about what Madame Eva told us?”

He looks at Jeremiah now, with a snigger.
“Isn’t knowledge your business? Gain their respect and I’m sure they would be happy to teach you more tricks.”


[11-Jun-21 09:11 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"Varian, with all due respect, I came here for one reason and one reason only. To kill that monster from the church. The direct path to that, in my mind, lies with Van Richten. The respect of the Vistani would warm my heart but that would mean very little if that devil rips it out of my chest. I hope you understand that my willingness to divert from the path at all is not something I would even consider under normal circumstances. But I owe you a life debt, and I intend to make good."


[11-Jun-21 09:12 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"What are the deaths of a few night hags? There will always be more monsters, they multiply like cockroaches. But if we were to kill Him, I might make a difference."


[11-Jun-21 09:24 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
😳 "Uh. *We*, might make a difference."


[12-Jun-21 10:06 AM] TenderstDM
Ireena steps forward, “Listen, I appreciate your desire to help - motivations aside. I am indeed eager to move on to Vallaki, but I have also sworn to protect those in need, and I honour this vow. Where I do take issue is with Night Hags.”

“Varian, I believe you have misunderstood, if the witches of Berez were involved the whole camp would be in grave danger. They are known for attracting people to their cause, but rarely children. Hags are a different matter, but no less sinister. These are not people but monstrosities. A Night Hag may take human form to walk amongst us, but only to torment its prey. A single Hag, *maybe*, we could handle. If there is a full coven, then it would be a short rescue, and a painful eternity in which to regret it. This would be an evil beyond any of us.”

“How did you come to be certain that Hags are at work here?”


[12-Jun-21 12:35 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian looks uncomfortable for a bit but tries to sound calm and not show emotions.

“I dreamt of this woman. In my dream, I was her child and she was embracing me. When I recognised her earlier I approached her and told her of it. She didn’t react well. She believes this means the night hags are back to the windmill on the road to Vallaki. She also believes I stole her child’s dream. I don’t understand how that could be, but I never intended it.”


[12-Jun-21 04:08 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
(Magda isn't there, but she's thinking about how Radu probably has 6 HP)


[19-Jun-21 01:25 PM] TenderstDM
During your last night at the Vistani camp there is further commotion. Three of the hunting party have returned, but not as they left. They stare blankly at their old friends – the three seem only to be shells of the people they once were. Tied to one, a bag of pastries and a note: 
*Dreams are for the living my dears, so do make the most of yours. 
Bella, Ofelia & Mother Mog.*

By the early morning, the whole camp is astir. As Ireena makes preparations to leave, a now familiar elf approaches the group. Radu wishes to speak with you.

“I hear talk that you were planning on taking on the hags. Our camp elders have been foolish, they believed that old mill to be cursed, but we should have burnt it to the ground years ago. Now the hags are back, and all we can do is put up charms to ward them off.”

“I admit I wronged you – I do what I need to keep going out here, and in all honesty, I’d do it again. That said, you look to aid us now, at great risk to your own.” Radu presents, and returns, a small lock of Magda’s hair, “I’m afraid I no longer have the others”.

“If you do go, don’t think you can win in a straight fight. Sometimes you gotta fight dirty. If you can disrupt that mill – we still know it as the Old Bonegrinder – you might buy us time to put up our wards, and send warning to Barovia Town and Vallaki.”

He rummages around in his pocket, “take this too, break the glass and it has a good shot at holding back anyone – or any hag – nearby.” He hands you a thin chain with a glass bead, clear but with flashes of purple when it catches the light. “I’ve been saving it for a sticky situation.”

With that, he turns to leave.

— VALLAKI DOWNTIME STARTS HERE —

Magda starts her first evening of downtime sitting in the tap room . She takes her cloak off and sits at a table by herself and catches her breath, looking up at the ceiling


[04-Jul-21 03:33 PM] TenderstDM
After sitting for a few minutes, a woman arrives at your table with a small goblet of wine, “Welcome to Vallaki my dear, I am Danika, Urwin’s wife.”

Shortly after Danika leaves the two men at the next table call out to you, “New to town, are we? And what pray tell earns you special treatment from the Martikovs?”


[04-Jul-21 04:29 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
I thank Danika for her kindness before she goes.

To the two men: "News travels fast here for such a big city, it seems. I'm afraid I don't know much about the Martikovs, but we helped the young Victor out of a sticky situation this afternoon. He found himself outside of the walls and the local... wildlife didn't seem to agree he should be there. We disagreed." She raises the goblet with a nod.

One turns to the other, “Barely in town a night, and already local heroes!”
“Perhaps you will join us for a hunt someday, you'll find all manner of interesting creatures in Barovia. Better be careful though, word from the Vistani is that hags roam our valley once more. It would be a terrible thing to find yourselves the ones being hunted...”
At this the two get up to leave, “I am Karl, and this is my brother Nikolai, sons of Lady Watcher. We’ll be seeing you again, I’m sure.”


[05-Jul-21 10:06 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
“Hags you say? We live in dangerous times indeed…”

I reach my hand out to shake theirs as they leave. “A pleasure to meet you both, gentlemen, and my regards to Lady Watcher.”

I think Magda would probably go to bed after finishing her wine, if only cos she can feel herself falling asleep now she's in a warm building. She says goodnight to Danika and Urwin on the way if she passes them

Varian has gone straight to his room as well

Ireena’s Morning:
The room is still dark when Ireena awakes – it has been another restless night. At a brisk pace, she could reach the Baron’s manor by sunrise. Perhaps she could be done with the uncomfortable pleasantries before midday. Moving for the hallway however, she senses movement on the other side of the door…

To freeze now might reveal that she had heard them. Instead, without breaking stride, she draws a blade, concealing it along the inside of her arm. With her free hand, she pushes open the door and steps forward. The corridor is long and dim, filled only with shadows. For a moment there is stillness, and then from above they are upon her. Ireena dives, rolling to the side in time to deflect a blow with her dagger. She kicks back with force throwing off her assailant. In the same moment, the door behind bursts open, a black bag is thrust over her head and the world goes dark. Heart racing, Ireena grabs out, and with considerable effort throws forward her would-be captor. She tosses aside the hood, revealing two figures ready to lunge at her once more. Ireena mutters beneath her breath, and two swords come crashing into a cloud of silvery mist. She is behind them now, her sword and dagger in hand. “You’re beaten, yield, or I will cut you down.”

The three remain still, breathing heavily, and then, without warning, the shorter of the two attackers falls forward giggling. Ireena, smirks, still catching her breath. “Brom and Bray Martikov, must we do this every time I am to visit?”
“Every time until we best Barovia’s Silver Knight!” the older of the two brothers says, turning to face her, “Mother reckoned we might win this time.”
Ireena scoffs, “It will take more than games and shadows to get the better of me.”

*****
By the time you head downstairs, the commotion in the hallway has past and Ireena has already left for the Baron’s manor. Danika greets you and offers a simple breakfast of oats and berries.

- Alek, the guard that met you and Victor at the wall, came by late last night. He has left directions to the home of [[Freek and Myrtle]], along with 50gp as thanks from the children’s fathers.
- Urwin sits with you awhile. He speculates more about the fate of his cousin over at the vineyard, perhaps he shall investigate himself. Business has been slow, they currently only have one other staying guest, although a well-paying one. Danton, the Great Performer. He’s here from Kresk to help with the Baron’s upcoming Festival of the Blazing Sun, and has become quite the local celebrity. He’s hard to pin down, but seems to frequent the toy maker Blinksy’s store - maybe you’re familiar with his wares?
- Danika suggests stopping by the church, Father Lucian knows everyone about town and could tell you Barovia’s history better than most. She also points you towards the markets, there are many stalls in the town square and shops squirrelled away down Vallaki’s cobbled streets. “Just yous be careful not to lose your feet, there’s no knowing where you might get swept off to!”


[13-Jul-21 12:36 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"Urwin, did you mention how far away your cousin's home is? Perhaps if we can organise arrangements for Danton, we can get some time and help you investigate."


[13-Jul-21 12:36 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Magda also makes a mental note that we should appoint a party treasurer 😆


[13-Jul-21 12:08 PM] pettypierrot#6397
"I second that - seems a crime that a lovely establishment such as this be deprived of it's wine stock. Plus it's been a while since my last gander around a vineyard"


[13-Jul-21 12:10 PM] pettypierrot#6397
Arlo asks about the markets, and whether there's anyone there who he could commission to make adjustments to his handaxes. He seems in need of some silver.

[13-Jul-21 07:50 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian will tag along Arlo and look for a way to silver his weapons. While walking around the market he looks for a gift for the weens, a small toy or plushie, something with a rose theme would catch his eyes!
He’ll also try to find out if there’s a thieves’ guild and how he can access it.


[13-Jul-21 07:54 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
I would like to seek out Karl and Nikolai again and Lady Watcher if possible (if it’s a downtime-accessible activity) — if not, I wouldn’t mind seeing what Ireena is up to


[13-Jul-21 10:09 PM] TenderstDM
Urwin replies, “You are mighty kind the both of you! Perhaps I worry needlessly, my cousin and his family are a capable sorts… still, I will see what more I can learn and will keep you informed.” 
“As for Danton, I suspect he might be heading on his way after the festival.”

Turning to @magdalena, “Now if you are looking to engage with Lady Watcher, I can point you her way. Word to the wise though, there has long been tension between the Watcher and Vallakovich families, I would do my best to stay clear of that hornet’s nest.”


[13-Jul-21 10:11 PM] TenderstDM
@varian and @pettypierrot, could you both roll me an investigation check! We’ll take the highest between you and use that to figure how good a weapons shop you manage to find!
Once Brom and Bray hear you are looking for toys they insist you stop by Blinksy’s, we’ll get to that after the weapons though 😊


[13-Jul-21 10:12 PM] TenderstDM
@Valdrid Usually, you would easily notice the tell-tale signs and symbols that mark the entrances to a city’s underworld. Vallaki seems strangely absent of such signs, perhaps wandering the streets you will be to hear that secret mix of dialect and jargon used to covey messages in thieves’ circles.


[13-Jul-21 10:12 PM] TenderstDM
@jeremiah Urwin notices you looking somewhat unsatisfied with a simple breakfast of oats, he slips you a plate of glistening crisped bacon – “You look a little pale son, best be keeping some meat on those bones!”

“Thank you, friend. I will keep that in mind. I’m no stranger to old families, they collect grudges like misers hoard pennies. But I suspect we can be of use to them, and if we can do so without angering the Vallakoviches, I think it would be in all of our interests. But if it is as you say… perhaps we should reunite with our young friend Viktor first, hm? 😉”

[15-Jul-21 09:17 PM] TenderstDM
Both excellent rolls :boudicca: 
In the heart of town you find a busy blacksmith signposted ‘The Authors of Iron’. The prices and craftsmanship appear reasonable but as you’re hanging back observing the wares you overhear two dwarves sniggering amongst themselves. To you Arlo it sounds like drunken ramblings, but Varian, you pick up on the true conversation spoken in Thieve’s Cant!
“Can you believe the city guards wear this scrap? Probably looks alright to them, poor bastards…”
Subtly you let it be known that you have understood their discussion. Now usually one rogue would welcome another, but these two, they stand uneasy as they size you up, “I don’t recognise the face, but I’ll be damned if I ain’t staring into the eyes of the guard captain. Who are you Drow, and what business do you have with us here?”


[15-Jul-21 09:17 PM] TenderstDM
Brom appears around 12, and his brother Bray, 14 or so. In moments of excitement there is a childish glee about them, but they speak confidently to you, and work hard at their duties around the Inn.

“Victor’s a troubled lad, but I get the feeling he means well. As does his farther deep down, beyond the madness that drives him now. Anyway, if you want to find Lady Watcher, you’ll be best heading towards the church and then heading right off Old Svalich Road, you won’t miss her manor.”
…
Sure enough, you find the house without trouble - identifiable by its tower with a brass framed window, shaped like an eye watching over the town below. Lavishly dressed guests appear to be arriving, but a Tiefling woman stops you at the gates, “The Lady doesn’t care for you commonfolk standing and gawking – off with you now.”


[15-Jul-21 11:28 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Magda snorts. "My goodness, it's been several lifetimes since anyone called me 'commonfolk'. 😆 Thank you for that, darling. That's made my day."


[15-Jul-21 11:28 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
She peers over the guard's shoulder past the gates. "Tell me, is there some kind of event going on? If it's not a good time, I can come back later. I was hoping to catch Karl and Nikolai, they mentioned something about a hunt to me last night? "


[16-Jul-21 10:46 AM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
What do they mean by this? Was Herrotir the guard captain?


[16-Jul-21 10:48 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
(I had the same question, I wasn't sure if I was just being thick 😆 )


[16-Jul-21 10:50 AM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
That’s just me asking. Varian says:
“My name is Varian and I have just recently, and unexpectedly, gotten into Barovia. It feels odd not knowing anyone about, as you probably understand. It’s a relief to hear the cant, tho! It’d be a pleasure to make your proper acquaintances and get more familiar without city. I just overheard you speaking of the low quality of this blacksmith. Would you recommend somewhere else?”

The Tiefling woman doesn’t look kindly towards being called darling,
“The boys do like to size up new visitors in town, but that doesn’t grant you special privileges here. If you seek an audience with the Lady it will have to be through invitation - if you are indeed nobility I’m sure your welcome is already in the post…
As for hunting, an activity I feel far better suited to your sorts, there is a notice board in the town square where outings are advertised. Nikolai and Carl usually run with the wolf-catchers, but you’ll find all sorts on there. Good hunting to you.
With this she makes a show of dismissing you and returning to her post.


[17-Jul-21 11:51 AM] TenderstDM
@arlo @varian 
After a pause, one dwarf turns to the other, “Seems genuinely clueless to me, suppose there wouldn’t be any harm in sending them over to The Prince!
“If your new in town and looking for gear you won’t find finer than at Prince Rupert’s.” The two point you along your way before returning to their business.

Hidden just off the main streets you find an arched opening in the brick wall, a sweltering heat emanating from within. Entering you are greeted with a roaring voice and the sight of a Dragonborn breathing flame into his furnace, “Welcome friends, you have stumbled across ol’ Rupert’s lair!”
“Now I don’t suppose you’d be the new folks in town that saved Freek, Myrtle, along with young master Victor from a spot of bother?”
Without letting you get a word in edgewise; he excitedly brings you over to his wares. Rows of blades hang from the walls, each made from a blackened steel. 
- Prince Rupert’s weapons sell for standard prices, but imbued with dragon flame, the black steel deals magical damage (https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Weapons#content).
- He’ll be happy to silver existing weapons for a third of their original price.
“And these, these here’d be the best you’ll find in all Barovia, or elsewhere!” He unfurls a roll of baldes and axe heads each forged out of deep red glass. It’s taken me years to get the tempering right, but undoubtedly, they’re my finest work. The blades themselves thirst for combat; the glass edge only gets sharper with use. I call them Lifehunters.”
- Lifehunt weapons are +1 magic weapons, they go for 20gp + three times the normal weapon price. Upon hitting a target, the following attack made with the weapon gains an additional +1 to hit.

At least you couldn't go lower than 5! I wouldn't have you mugged for an 8!
That said, the magic store you do come across seems to sell mostly trinkets. There are dusty old books, simple charms for sale - although nothing past 1st level, and a small row of potions that look to be overpriced. By far worst of all however, is the plaque on the wall, "Fantastical Billowing Cloak: Wonder of Villaki!"
In the cloak's place, instead a sign hangs, "SOLD".

You most certainly do! You find The Little Book of Necromancy tucked away amongst the shelves,
It contains mostly edgy prose about how cool death is, and how to mix up the very best gothic eye shadow. Near the back however are 4 listed spells,
Ray of Sickness,
Inflict Wounds,
False Life,
& Cause Fear.
The book itself is only 1gp, but copying the spells into your own book will require the usual time and monetary cost!

At the church you see a familiar woman, Sasha from your travels here, talking with what looks to be the priest. They are standing just outside the church, speaking somewhat discreetly. Sasha looks far more nervous than when you met her previously, and she rushes off after handing something to the man.

Shortly after, Magda returns round the corner from Lady Watcher’s manor and sees you, @jeremiah. The two of you together are free to approach the church, although we can pick up here in game!

You would be able to find such a thing at the same apothecary that Varian visited to identify his potions! (although on your own you wouldn't be aware of the under the table poison trade going on)

A weak sleeping draught that only aids with sleep as opposed to knocking people out would be relatively cheap, you could get a weeks supply for a couple of GP

At breakfast Urwin comes over to you and puts a small envelope on your table, “Almost forgot in all the chaos this morning, [[Jakob]] came by with this. I hope it's good news."

The letter reads:

*Friends,

I have been digging around since we spoke, and it occurred to me that perhaps young Victor might be of help in identifying our lost wizard. I mentioned to him your interest and he became most exited indeed! His grandfather hid most of the city’s records decades back, but Victor has since recovered many of the arcane texts for his studies. We have uncovered a name, Iggwilv.

You may know her as Tasha the Dark.

bones make the church not desecrated, allows for holy water


[21-Nov-21 10:53 AM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
We had a long rest though


[21-Nov-21 10:53 AM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
so a day passed


[21-Nov-21 10:54 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
The long rest was the day we spent walking around the town etc etc, i definitely cast it on that day


[21-Nov-21 10:55 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Like we’re actually counting the amount of 24 Hour Periods in Strahd, not just between long rests


[21-Nov-21 10:55 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
It’s getting late in the day but so long as I cast it on you tomorrow we should be fine


[21-Nov-21 10:55 AM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
I thought we needed to not cast to get the long rest


[21-Nov-21 10:56 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
If that’s the case you’re fucked XD cos if you need it every day and a long rest requires 24 hours without casting a spell


[21-Nov-21 10:56 AM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
Eh, we'll figure it out


[21-Nov-21 11:09 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)

Magda hovers over the Lady Watcher’s body. “What do I do?” she asks the party. “I know what I want to do, what my blood is screaming for constantly, but I’ve learned to ignore it. So what’s the right thing to do? And why would he do this?”

[31-Dec-21 03:50 PM] pettypierrot#6397
“I think it would be wise to play Mr Strahds game for a while, until we’re ready to pay him back his dues”


[31-Dec-21 03:52 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
“We are rats on his operating table.” She rattles her fingers off the desk. “Normally my impulse right about now is to flip the table over completely. As it is, I don’t even know what that would look like…”


[31-Dec-21 03:52 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
“Why do I get the feeling this is the bait….. and there’s a hook coming?”


[31-Dec-21 03:55 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
“Exactly my thoughts. If Strahd has this kind of power over Sasha, what’s to say he won’t have it over you once you drink Lady Watcher’s blood? Is this a risk we can take?”


[31-Dec-21 03:56 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
“But those are innocent people dying downstairs. Is Lady Watcher’s life worth more than theirs?”


[31-Dec-21 03:59 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
“I don’t see why he couldn’t just do that to me now though. Strahd is stronger than any vampire I’ve met and I’m barely subsisting on chickens.”


[31-Dec-21 03:59 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
“…. we couldn’t take her at our current skill level. It would folly to try…” She thinks about it. “Would it?”


[31-Dec-21 04:03 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
“Take Sasha out?” Varian looks at the party, noticing everyone’s wounds, “I don’t think we could.”


[31-Dec-21 04:06 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Magda looks around the room, at each of them in turn. “This is such a bad idea….” But she gets up.


[31-Dec-21 04:09 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
She leans over the Lady Watcher’s body, and whispers something in her ear.

||”I have not drank human blood in over half a century. I have tried to be good. But for you, you wicked hag, I will make an exception.”||

It is quick, and gory, and visceral. Bits of throat splatter across the table, arterial spray in a fountain, then down to a splutter. Magda stands, eyes like pinpricks, drenched in red.

She wipes her lips with the back of her hand, and then slurps the wipings. “How… quickly I forget,” she says to herself. She’s laughing. Breathless. She just stands in a moment in it, closing her eyes. The Lady Watcher crumbles into dust on the table. 

Magda opens her eyes. She’s looking at the party now. Like she’s still lost in the sauce. 

Like she’s still hungry.

For a moment the church falls still, and then the catacomb’s door creaks open. At first a few townsfolk emerge, exhausted from their attempts to break the lock, and then the rest come. Battered and wounded, slowly they trickle out, a seemingly unending sea of broken faces. Father Lucian begins to guide people out into the street, cautiously at first, but it appears the city is quiet, apart from the sound of rain.

As the crowd thins, a bat escapes, flapping madly before taking off through a shattered window. And then the final figures emerge - **and the dice are rolled.**

Dargos Weerdo limps past, he manages to catch your eye and asks you to come see him before leaving town.

Alek is the last of the guards to come up, helping carry the wounded, “five dead he says… well, five in the catacombs, many more in the streets.”

Prince Rupert follows behind, cradling the body of Urwin Martikov. 
“One moment she was crying with her head in her hands, the next she came at us hungry and snarling. Father Lucian was a fool to take Sasha in, all vampires belong to their master… Urwin was barely back on his feet before he gave the last of his life, protecting the townsfolk down there”. 
The Dragonborn cannot cry, but the pain is clear in Prince Rupert’s eyes.

Nobody seems keen to stay inside for long, and soon you are alone in the broken hall. A faint blue glow emanates from an amulet in the ash where Fiona’s body lay, the same you saw her clutching before she was overcome by shadows.

Blinksy remains at the door, staring out. The church grounds are a mess of rubble and embers, no trace of the vampire spawn remains. In the dim light of the afternoon, the Eye of the Watcher manor gazes down over the town. Able townsfolk and the remaining guards tend to the wounded and start clearing the streets.

*In the direction of the Baron’s home, wisps of smoke can be seen in the distance.*

(Just to add to this bit as I forgot to reply!) Arlo flinches when Magda grabs his wrist, but quickly recovers and levels her with an earnest look. “I wouldn’t have become who I am without dancing with darkness occasionally. You have that darkness, but also a lot of light. Life is about balance” he looks at Magdas blood drenched form, and then meets her eyes meaningfully, “and moderation”

As you approach the Baron’s manor, you can hear the fire hissing violently in the rain. The whole place is ablaze, and the front of the house has been completely blown to pieces. Nobody inside could still be alive.

As you stand staring, a hand reaches out touching your shoulder. You turn to see Victor, his mum and Stella beside him. Victor falls forward, sobbing in your arms.
“Our home… our home is gone. And my father. My father is dead…”
Lydia Vallakovich looks to you all, “A guard came to warn us, Karl Watcher approached the manor, full of rage and madness. He tore the house apart with fireballs, with us inside. He meant for us to die.”
“But Victor saved us!” Stella steps forward, taking hold of Victor’s hand, “He did it. His circle worked and it transported us to the edge of town. Had you not healed him, we all would have perished.”

Stella shakes a little, and it seems the tremendous weight of the day falls upon each of you.
Something brushes past your legs, and you look down to see a familiar cat, its rightful mind finally returned.

If it passes the vibe check:


[10-Jan-22 04:01 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
While Magda is preparing the campfire, surreptitiously: "You're not looking well, Jeremiah. And I'm noticing that salve I keep making you is having less and less of an effect. How do you feel?"


[10-Jan-22 05:25 PM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
"What? No, it's working fine, I don't think Borovia agrees with me is all. I'm sure everyone feels the same."


[10-Jan-22 05:26 PM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
Jeremiah rolls out his bed and climbs in "Goodnight Magda"


[10-Jan-22 05:28 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Magda waits for Varian to go past before whispering into the bedroll. "Does Arlo look like he's wasting away? Does Varian? And there's..." She groans. "Listen, just trust me. I'm a cleric. I can sense something off with you. It's getting worse."


[10-Jan-22 05:36 PM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
"I'm just not as strong as them, you've all been going out adventuring for years, I've been mopping floors all my life" He turns over in his bed roll. "How do you even know what I'm supposed to be like? Have you ever even met another half-goblin?"


[10-Jan-22 05:39 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"If I'm going to be honest with you, I didn't know they existed until I met you." She takes a deep breath. "Ninth Circle, you're going to make me say it." She makes sure no-one is listening.


[10-Jan-22 05:41 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"Jeremiah, I can see people's heartbeats. I can hear their blood pounding. Ever since Lady Watcher, I have to keep reminding myself that you're all still people, that you're not just bags of blood to drain. Even my friends." She looks up at Arlo and Varian across the campsite. "But not you. There's something wrong with your blood, I can smell it. Like you'd give me food poisoning. And it's getting worse."


[10-Jan-22 05:43 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"You can't keep pretending it's not happening. I've seen it before. Someone buries their head in the sand until they're growing fangs. I don't want to kill you Jeremiah. We have to deal with this."


[10-Jan-22 05:46 PM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
"What do you expect me to do Magda? We're already going to Kresk, do you want me to lie awake at night worrying? I've followed every lead as best I can, the only thing I could have done better was to abandon the bonegrinder and Vallaki"


[10-Jan-22 05:49 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"No-one except you knows how bad it's getting. And you just tried to tell me it was just because you were tired. Our current plan is to stop on the way to Kresk. Because you won't communicate. Should we bypass the tower and head straight to Kresk?" She shrugs. "I have no idea. Because you won't talk about it."


[10-Jan-22 05:54 PM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
"Frankly, I was telling the truth then, but you know, rotting blood and all that changed my mind. Let's talk about it in the morning, you're not getting me to stay up through your shift that easily" He manages a slight smile then turns back over


[10-Jan-22 05:58 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
She smiles. "Sure. You watch out for me, I'll watch out for you. Us infected have to stick together." She stirs the fire, and looks over to the others just going to bed. Watching their pulses slow in the dark as they relax. As they let their guards down. She pauses... and then shakes herself to remind her of who she is, and what she isn't.

While we're climbing the hill alongside the horses, Magda says to @varian : "You know, that's two of my lives I owe you now. I'm racking up quite the debt."


[17-Jan-22 12:17 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian, although looking exhausted, seems to have a spring in his step, a sparkle in his eyes. He looks at Magda and smiles.
"I believe you have saved mine at least twice by now. If you are wanting to keep tabs, I'd say we're even."
He looks into the middle distance, fidgeting with his ring for a second.
"Plus, you have aided me in recovering and protecting something much more valuable than my physical health."


[17-Jan-22 12:21 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"Ah! The child." She snorts. "Tell me, is she settling back into her jewellery nicely? On an entirely selfish level, I'm glad to have her wandering around helping us. We'll certainly need all the help we can get."


[17-Jan-22 12:24 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
"As eager as she is to help, I... don't want her to be hurt again."


[17-Jan-22 12:28 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian's smile wanes.
"Having been taken hostage by hags and imprisoned in the body of a hellhound doesn't seem to have been excitement enough for her."
His tone suggests he's said this before, more than once.


[17-Jan-22 12:36 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"Well. I expect if it was peace she wanted, she would have chosen to move on, and obey the natural order." Magda claps Varian on the shoulder. "It seems your little one has chosen violence."


[17-Jan-22 12:36 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"I can't say I don't understand her point of view. If I wanted to die on the road like that thief back there, I could've done it 200 years ago. But it seems you'll always be there to pull her out of trouble, just like you did with me with the hags."


[17-Jan-22 12:42 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
"When Rose asked me to take her with me, I didn't expect her to be choosing violence over peace. She had enough of it growing up..."
He looks concerned at your remark, almost sad while saying this.


[17-Jan-22 12:51 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
"Her curiosity and wonder of the world is all I wish for her to keep experiencing. But I'm afraid you're right. My own life is permeated by violence. How would I be able to keep her from it? And if she chose to come with me, maybe she knew that all along."


[17-Jan-22 01:56 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"You seem so desperate for her to find peace, and yet... you want none of it for yourself. If you chose to go live on a farm like that irritating little girl, Rose would go with you. You would never want for anything. You would spend your days watching the sun rise and fall, never impacting anything, never being impacted by anything else. .... Frankly, I can't imagine a worse form of torture."


[17-Jan-22 01:58 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"I sense a great torment in you, Varian. You have something out there you need to do. I would like to help you do it, as your friend. But it's your decision. And Rose follows you. She would follow you into hell. In fact -- she already did. And she followed you back out again."


[17-Jan-22 04:51 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian chuckles.
"I believe peace might start with freedom. And, for as long as I can remember, I've been bound to forces too powerful for me to ran away from. First, it was my family. They worked very hard to find the right skill set that would make me useful, and trained me well in it. If for nothing else, I am grateful to them for that. But the Drow are not concerned with peace.
And, when I thought I would finally be able to find some freedom, I was taken here.”

[17-Jan-22 04:56 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
“Maybe I could have found peace in Barovia. My family wouldn’t be able to find me and I would be free to carve my own path. 
But old dreams still clung to me. To survive in the wilds of the Underdark, one must not delay when the Spider Queen bestows her gifts. For with even the slightest hesitation, the briefest moment of doubt, she will snatch back her blessing, depriving her chosen of the wonders of her favour. And I’d waited for her favour for so long.”


[17-Jan-22 05:01 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
“I sold my soul for power and am now bound to a new force, and one much harder to ran from."


[17-Jan-22 05:01 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Magda thinks of the battlefield, sparkling with Lolth's Fire. "What price will you pay for that favour? What cost would it extract?"


[17-Jan-22 05:07 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
"Servitude and loyalty."


[17-Jan-22 05:15 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"I thought I knew you better than that, Varian. We are in the arsehole of the planar system. We can serve no-one but ourselves if we want to get out alive." She stops. "Lolth... A dark queen of the gods. A dangerous thing. The gods and monsters I've met, all men. Scheming men, lying men, but... in the end, simple. Stupid. A matriarch... she must be truly terrifying. But you can tell her you already have a queen." She scratches behind her horse's ears. "Isn't that right, Icarus?"

[17-Jan-22 05:28 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
She looks at Varian over her shoulder. "Do you want her favour? Would it bring you joy?"


[17-Jan-22 05:32 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian chuckles and his eyes twinkle impishly.
"I am sorry to add to the stack of stupid men you've met.  
No, Lolth will bring me no joy. Lolth watches, Lolth tests and, above all, Lolth consumes. I don’t know what Her plans are, but at least for now our goals are aligned.”


[17-Jan-22 05:36 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
She shrugs. "It's just your nature. Though, you are neither a god nor a monster." She looks at his red eyes. "That I know of."


[17-Jan-22 05:39 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"When you find that Lolth's goals do not align with your own anymore, let me know. Whatever your Spider Queen wants with you here, it cannot be good."


[17-Jan-22 05:54 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian looks warily at Magda.
“No, I don’t think it will be. And She will discard me as easily as She did Izek. Or try.”


[17-Jan-22 05:57 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"Oh!" Magda blinks. "Well in that case, you're fine. Unless you plan on chaining yourself to a wall and stabbing yourself in the neck."

[17-Jan-22 06:52 PM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
"That was my answer!" "also, it's if you had to"


[17-Jan-22 06:52 PM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
Like Allesandra has told you to


[17-Jan-22 06:53 PM] pettypierrot#6397
Ah I see! I think I’m starting to get the game now!


[17-Jan-22 08:32 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian rolls his eyes and looks back at Magda.
“You remind me of my people. Males are merely tolerated, useful primarily for physical and skilled labour, and breeding purposes.”


[17-Jan-22 08:35 PM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
"You breed Porpoises Varian?"

"Oh, you misunderstand me, Varian. I love men. I've just learned not to expect them to put their egos second."


[17-Jan-22 08:43 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"They look at you like an object even as you've cut down their armies. They whine and whine about their honour while stabbing each other in the back. They talk over you, they talk down to you...." She shrugs. "But it doesn't mean I hate them on principle."


[17-Jan-22 08:50 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian looks shocked! “A man would dare talk over you?”


[17-Jan-22 08:51 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
“Surface dwellers are even stranger than what we were told.”

Magda puts the pieces together. "Ah. Of course. The drow matriarchy."


[17-Jan-22 08:55 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"It's funny you mention it actually. Barovia has been... more egalitarian than most of the places I've spent my life. But believe me when I tell you, in my 250 years, I have..."


[17-Jan-22 08:55 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
She sighs like she doesn't even have the energy to put it into words.


[17-Jan-22 08:56 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"Trust me. Most men on the surface think your brain is going to overheat at any moment, it's exhausting."


[17-Jan-22 08:57 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
She smiles at Jeremiah, changing the subject. "You were saying about porpoises, darling."

(Can I have Magda gather the materials for Find Familiar in the wee house?)


[10-Mar-22 04:36 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
like if Arabelle would have them lying around


[19-Mar-22 03:21 PM] TenderstDM
Absolutely, sorry I didn't see this!


[19-Mar-22 03:21 PM] TenderstDM
What is it you're looking for?


[19-Mar-22 03:23 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
10gp worth of charcoal, incense, and herbs


[19-Mar-22 03:23 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
;D


[19-Mar-22 03:55 PM] TenderstDM
Arabelle drags a stool over by the kitchen table, she hops up and starts rummaging around the top shelves. She comes back down with a few sage leaves and then scoops some charcoal out from the back of the stove. For a moment it looks as if she's forgotten something, before she reaches into her apron pocket, pulling out a handful of little incense cones.
"That do you?"


[19-Mar-22 09:06 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Magda smiles wickedly. “I can make do in a pinch.” She takes them out into the back garden and starts carving a pentacle into the ground with a stick.

You sure can! Upstairs you come across what looks like it might be Arabelle's parent's room. She's told you to make yourself at home, and you find some thread and needles in the bedside drawer.


[19-Mar-22 10:55 PM] TenderstDM
***

Arabelle putters around tidying the kitchen, the last of her visitors having retired for the night.
A black and brown tabby pushes up against her feet. "Hey Kasa" she bends down and ruffles the cat’s fur, "You be careful girl. A shadow haunts these people, and I don't know if they can see it."
She walks over and inspects the scorched mark left from the Taroka reading. A grim fortune, but these travellers seemed not to be bound by fate. They turned away from the path of the Wizard, and now the card belongs to them. She reaches for the deck – The Thief, Anarchist and the Horseman... she shudders.

Kasa's tail twitches as she watches Arabelle's eyes cloud over.


[19-Mar-22 10:56 PM] TenderstDM
*A vision forms of a small room, scattered with scrolls and arcane trinkets. A knight, clad in silver, and a Vistani woman, are both crouching down by an older man. He looks dazed, clutching an unmarked tome. The knight knocks the book from the man’s hands, wrapping it in cloth before picking it back up.

A raven is perched in the window, its beak wide with distress. The knight lifts the man, carrying him towards a tall mirror. She lights two sconces by the mirror’s side, and the reflection shifts, revealing a passage. They begin their escape.*


[19-Mar-22 10:56 PM] TenderstDM
*Meanwhile, the Vistani woman has drawn her rapier, and is now pacing the room in wait. An elvish man emerges from the stairway - the Devil’s servant. He sees the mirror passage and steps toward it, he has come with a single purpose. A flash of steel cuts across his face, and he turns to the woman, smiling back at him. There is no time for this. He unsheathes his sword, and with unsettling speed lunges forward.

His blows are swift and merciless, but the Vistani woman keeps a step ahead. He pulls down a bookcase, knocking her aside, allowing him to move once more towards the mirror. Before he can step through, the glass shatters. He turns to see the smoke trailing from the woman’s pistol. A twitch of anger crosses his face, he sighs and steps back across the broken shards.

They each circle the room, knowing now there is no other way for this to end. Together they move forward, and their blades meet again. The two dance back and forth, each step the difference between life and death. With her good leg, the woman kicks out, knocking her foe off balance. With a flurry of blows she manages to disarm the elf and holds her rapier to his neck.

The woman allows her breathing to slow, she goes to speak, but something isn’t right. She has defeated this man, but then why is she so afraid. Fear like she hasn’t felt in many years. A tingle moves up her spine and her hand trembles. It’s his eyes, his eyes are wrong, there is so much pain in them and she can’t bring herself to look away. Then the screaming starts. Hundreds of voices crying out. They fill the room, her ears ring, and then there is nothing but those agonising screams.*

The rapier falls to the ground, and Arabelle awakes. Kasa is there, nuzzling her face, and the kitchen slowly comes back into focus.

[20-Mar-22 12:46 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Fjdjfjdjfj NO SURELY NOT


[20-Mar-22 12:46 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
this must be a future yet to pass right?? Or something? 🥺


[20-Mar-22 12:57 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Once Varian hears Arabelle’s vision he asks “Do you have visions come to you often? I think the people you saw were Danton, Ireena and Ezmeralda. We were meant to meet them at the tower by the lake, just East of here. Can you tell if this is a vision of the past, present or a premonition of the future?”


[30-Mar-22 07:49 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Magda is still casting Find Familiar outside, drawing her wee chalk circle and lighting the incense in her brazier. It flashes, and becomes a familiar large yellow snake.
“Hello, my dear,” she smiles. It rattles angrily and she picks a few owl feathers out of its neck. “Oh, I knowww, I’m sorry.”

“I’m afraid I don’t know, but it’s been my experience that the truth usually takes the form you would least like it to…” Arabelle stares at the ground and shuffles her feet.

With a start, she looks back up, “That said, fate’s a funny thing!”

“I’ve been thinking too. I’m going to come with you when you head out for Berez. I know you’ve not been asked to go yet, but once you have, I’ll be there.”
She stands looking pleased with her decision for a moment, before turning about on the spot, “Now, time for breakfast! Who wants eggs? Nom nom, only the best from my hens.”

[22-Apr-22 11:45 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
of course!!


[22-Apr-22 11:58 AM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
After Magda says she can't keep going with horses and chickens, Varian nods at her and says "We all have our trials to overcome. Hold on to what you believe in and you'll restore what is rightfully yours."


[22-Apr-22 12:02 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"I don't know what I believe anymore... I used to be so sure. Nowadays, it feels like everything's on the table. It'll all be so much easier once I've put a stake through that bastard's heart. It'll all be over..."


[22-Apr-22 12:03 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
"I guess you're right. I can hold onto that. Thank you, friend."
