# Downtime - Krezk

## Heart-to-heart on the walk to the stables

[17-Jan-22 11:12 AM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
While we're climbing the hill alongside the horses, [[Magda]] says to @varian : "You know, that's two of my lives I owe you now. I'm racking up quite the debt."

[17-Jan-22 12:17 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian, although looking exhausted, seems to have a spring in his step, a sparkle in his eyes. He looks at [[Magda]] and smiles.
"I believe you have saved mine at least twice by now. If you are wanting to keep tabs, I'd say we're even."
He looks into the middle distance, fidgeting with his ring for a second.
"Plus, you have aided me in recovering and protecting something much more valuable than my physical health."

[17-Jan-22 12:21 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
"Ah! The child." She snorts. "Tell me, is she settling back into her jewellery nicely? On an entirely selfish level, I'm glad to have her wandering around helping us. We'll certainly need all the help we can get."

[17-Jan-22 12:24 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
"As eager as she is to help, I... don't want her to be hurt again."

[17-Jan-22 12:28 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian's smile wanes.
"Having been taken hostage by [[hags]] and imprisoned in the body of a hellhound doesn't seem to have been excitement enough for her."
His tone suggests he's said this before, more than once.

[17-Jan-22 12:36 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
"Well. I expect if it was peace she wanted, she would have chosen to move on, and obey the natural order." [[Magda]] claps Varian on the shoulder. "It seems your little one has chosen violence."

"I can't say I don't understand her point of view. If I wanted to die on the road like that thief back there, I could've done it 200 years ago. But it seems you'll always be there to pull her out of trouble, just like you did with me with the [[hags]]."

[17-Jan-22 12:42 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
"When [[Rose]] asked me to take her with me, I didn't expect her to be choosing violence over peace. She had enough of it growing up..."
He looks concerned at your remark, almost sad while saying this.

[17-Jan-22 12:51 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
"Her curiosity and wonder of the world is all I wish for her to keep experiencing. But I'm afraid you're right. My own life is permeated by violence. How would I be able to keep her from it? And if she chose to come with me, maybe she knew that all along."

[17-Jan-22 01:56 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
"You seem so desperate for her to find peace, and yet... you want none of it for yourself. If you chose to go live on a farm like that irritating little girl, [[Rose]] would go with you. You would never want for anything. You would spend your days watching the sun rise and fall, never impacting anything, never being impacted by anything else. .... Frankly, I can't imagine a worse form of torture."

"I sense a great torment in you, Varian. You have something out there you need to do. I would like to help you do it, as your friend. But it's your decision. And [[Rose]] follows you. She would follow you into hell. In fact -- she already did. And she followed you back out again."

[17-Jan-22 04:51 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian chuckles.
"I believe peace might start with freedom. And, for as long as I can remember, I've been bound to forces too powerful for me to ran away from. First, it was my family. They worked very hard to find the right skill set that would make me useful, and trained me well in it. If for nothing else, I am grateful to them for that. But the Drow are not concerned with peace.
And, when I thought I would finally be able to find some freedom, I was taken here.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe I could have found peace in Barovia. My family wouldn‚Äôt be able to find me and I would be free to carve my own path. 
But old dreams still clung to me. To survive in the wilds of the Underdark, one must not delay when the Spider Queen bestows her gifts. For with even the slightest hesitation, the briefest moment of doubt, she will snatch back her blessing, depriving her chosen of the wonders of her favour. And I‚Äôd waited for her favour for so long.‚Äù

‚ÄúI sold my soul for power and am now bound to a new force, and one much harder to ran from."

[17-Jan-22 05:01 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
[[Magda]] thinks of the battlefield, sparkling with Lolth's Fire. "What price will you pay for that favour? What cost would it extract?"

[17-Jan-22 05:07 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
"Servitude and loyalty."

[17-Jan-22 05:15 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
"I thought I knew you better than that, Varian. We are in the arsehole of the planar system. We can serve no-one but ourselves if we want to get out alive." She stops. "Lolth... A dark queen of the gods. A dangerous thing. The gods and monsters I've met, all men. Scheming men, lying men, but... in the end, simple. Stupid. A matriarch... she must be truly terrifying. But you can tell her you already have a queen." She scratches behind her horse's ears. "Isn't that right, Icarus?"

üê¥: *pfpfpf*

She looks at Varian over her shoulder. "Do you want her favour? Would it bring you joy?"

[17-Jan-22 05:32 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian chuckles and his eyes twinkle impishly.
"I am sorry to add to the stack of stupid men you've met.  
No, Lolth will bring me no joy. Lolth watches, Lolth tests and, above all, Lolth consumes. I don‚Äôt know what Her plans are, but at least for now our goals are aligned.‚Äù

[17-Jan-22 05:36 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
She shrugs. "It's just your nature. Though, you are neither a god nor a monster." She looks at his red eyes. "That I know of."

"When you find that Lolth's goals do not align with your own anymore, let me know. Whatever your Spider Queen wants with you here, it cannot be good."

[17-Jan-22 05:54 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian looks warily at [[Magda]].
‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt think it will be. And She will discard me as easily as She did [[Izek]]. Or try.‚Äù

[17-Jan-22 05:57 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
"Oh!" [[Magda]] blinks. "Well in that case, you're fine. Unless you plan on chaining yourself to a wall and stabbing yourself in the neck."

[17-Jan-22 06:09 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian laughs. "I wouldn't want to make it easier to whoever She recruits next."

[17-Jan-22 06:14 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
"If we see any other drow with red eyes, I'll be on the lookout." She looks over her shoulder at [[Jeremiah]] and [[Arlo]] talking quietly in the back. ".... what do you think they talk about?" she says quietly.

[17-Jan-22 06:30 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian looks back and shrugs. "I wouldn't have a clue. Do you?"

[17-Jan-22 06:33 PM] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him)
**"Shag Lolth, Kill Tallus, Marry Gruumsh"**

[17-Jan-22 06:38 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
‚ÄúSee?‚Äù [[Magda]] says to Varian. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs their nature.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait five minutes, they‚Äôll start comparing sizes.‚Äù

[17-Jan-22 06:51 PM] [[Arlo]] de Le√≥n (he/him)
‚ÄúI can imagine no other reality where I am not happily marrying, ‚Äú‚Äùshagging‚Äù‚Äù and killing for my Allessandra, [[Jeremiah]]. I don‚Äôt understand this game‚Äù

‚ÄúBut out of interest‚Ä¶. What would your answer to this hypothetical be?‚Äù

[17-Jan-22 06:52 PM] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him)
"That was my answer!" "also, it's if you had to"

[17-Jan-22 06:52 PM] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him)
Like Allesandra has told you to

[17-Jan-22 06:53 PM] [[Arlo]] de Le√≥n (he/him)
Ah I see! I think I‚Äôm starting to get the game now!

[17-Jan-22 08:32 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian rolls his eyes and looks back at [[Magda]].
‚ÄúYou remind me of my people. Males are merely tolerated, useful primarily for physical and skilled labour, and breeding purposes.‚Äù

[17-Jan-22 08:35 PM] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him)
"You breed Porpoises Varian?"

[17-Jan-22 08:37 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
"Oh, you misunderstand me, Varian. I love men. I've just learned not to expect them to put their egos second."

"They look at you like an object even as you've cut down their armies. They whine and whine about their honour while stabbing each other in the back. They talk over you, they talk down to you...." She shrugs. "But it doesn't mean I hate them on principle."

[17-Jan-22 08:50 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian looks shocked! ‚ÄúA man would dare talk over you?‚Äù

‚ÄúSurface dwellers are even stranger than what we were told.‚Äù

[17-Jan-22 08:53 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
[[Magda]] puts the pieces together. "Ah. Of course. The drow matriarchy."

"It's funny you mention it actually. Barovia has been... more egalitarian than most of the places I've spent my life. But believe me when I tell you, in my 250 years, I have..."

She sighs like she doesn't even have the energy to put it into words.

"Trust me. Most men on the surface think your brain is going to overheat at any moment, it's exhausting."

She smiles at [[Jeremiah]], changing the subject. "You were saying about porpoises, darling."
