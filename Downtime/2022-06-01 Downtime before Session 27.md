# Downtime - Vallaki (again)

## [[Jeremiah]] and Magda go hunting for rabbits (Day 24)

[[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him): *The morning, [[Jeremiah]] is waiting downstairs for the others to get up*
 
[16:33] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him): "Magda, can I ask about your feeding? You're in need of it, but could we just buy some chickens?"

[16:35] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him): "I know it's not the best, but if the blood doesn't have to be taken straight, we could source some donations maybe?"

[16:37] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): Magda looks more chipper than you've seen her in weeks as she prepares her bag for the day.

"[[Jeremiah]]. Good morning, I hope you slept well! ... Yes, I suppose we will need to source some chickens. My problem so far has been finding someone with disposable chickens, who won't ask questions when I come back every week for more."

[16:40] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him): [[Jeremiah]] seems emboldened by not being snapped at immediately. "Maybe we could go hunting this morning? There's no worry of not being let back in now [[lady Watcher]] is gone."

[16:41] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him): "possibly we could say we're bringing the chickens somewhere else, no one needs to know they don't make it to the destination"

[16:44] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): "That could work. I did do a similar trick once back in Castle Redis. It worked, for a few months. Eventually, the guy started thinking I was middle-manning him and wanted to know who I was selling them to, so he could sell them directly...." She zones out. "Always looking a gift horse in a mouth."

[16:45] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): "In all honesty, my plans today were to try and source some diamonds. I'm still incapable of bringing any of you back if you decide to pop your clogs." She sniffs. "For the moment at least, I still need you." She boops his nose. "But sure, we can hunt chickens."

[16:46] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him): "What do you mean, for the moment?"

[16:47] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): "A joke, dear." She hoists her rucksack onto her back. "I know I don't make them very often. I'm a little rusty."

[16:51] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him): "I mean, we're both immortal at this point, shall we go hunt this morning? I don't think [[Blinksy]] will be up for a while and he's who I would ask for diamonds"

[16:57] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): "Why not..."

[16:58] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): She gestures to the door. "Lead the way, ranger."

[17:00] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him): [[Jeremiah]] flinches slightly at ranger, but tries to shrug it off

[17:05] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): Magda looks confused. "Not taking to your new title? You were pretty handy back there with that bow, and leading us back to the path."

[17:07] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him): "Yeah, just reminds me I'm not who I want to be, who I left home to become"

[17:08] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him): "how are you doing with Varian's departure?"

[17:12] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): "Take it from an old lady. You never know what decisions will lead to the person you become. But with the benefit of hindsight... you see how inevitable everything was. It's quite freeing when you embrace it."

[17:14] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): She smarts at the sound of his name. "He's number two on my kill list. And as you know, it's a short list."

[21:13] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him): "Yeah, you hate him for it, we all do, and we'll figure out what to do about him together, but what else is it making you feel? I don't think I talked to him enough about anything, because it was hard, I don't want to make the same mistake again"

[21:18] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): Magda leans in, like she's trying to read his face. "Are you... trying to bond with me, [[Jerry]]?" She scoffs. "Is that what this is about?" She sighs. "I... I don't know. I haven't had many friends in my life. And I opened up when I got here, because the world was small now, and we seemed to have each others' backs. And it was a terrible mistake."

[21:21] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him): "Magda, without Varian we would have died many times over. Not least in that house in Barovia. If living to see today is a terrible mistake I don't want to be right"

[21:26] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): "No, I agree. We needed to work together. And we work well together... as colleagues. But that's all." She smiles. "I have big plans. And I can't do them alone. But I will keep in mind that, at the end of the day, I stand alone. No-one will catch me when I fall. Most of you probably won't even notice."

[21:28] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): "I don't know. Do you disagree? Do you feel a deep, loving kinship for us as a group? What do you want from this arrangement?"

[17:34] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him): "I don't think any of us stand alone, ever. You're a cleric, you've got someone to catch you when you from the ultimate fall, not many can say that. I don't feel kinship, I don't think any could after 3 weeks, but I have enough affection that I don't want anyone else to leave without us at least talking about it."

[17:36] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him): "I assume Varian didn't feel safe enough to give us reasons when he left, so much that he attacked [[Arlo]] of all people. Do you feel the same? Is there anything you want so much that you'd leave us all without a second thought?"

[17:59] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): "I've been nothing but open, the only thing I've ever wanted was Strahd's head on a stick. So long as you continue to help me with that, I would have no reason to leave." She sighs. "Though you do test my patience sometimes, as I've made clear."

[18:03] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): "I'm not a touchy-feely person, [[Jerry]]. I don't particularly care what Varian's reasons were. We helped him do horrible things, we killed Izek with... very little understanding of that situation, because we all understood our group was going to look out for each other. And look where that got us. [[Arlo]] bleeding out on the floor."

[18:08] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): "The worst bit? I nearly finished the job. My curse is getting worse, as I'm sure you've noticed."

[19:09] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him): "Yeah, at the time I thought it was just because he attacked us, and we wanted Watcher off our backs for a while. What do you mean you nearly finished the job? You nearly killed Strahd?"

[19:10] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him): [[Jeremiah]] sits down watching the rabbit burrow with his back against the tree

[19:11] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him): He tries to attach a paralyzing tentacle to a stick to put above the burrow

[19:55] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): "No. I almost killed [[Arlo]]. I'm not as resilient as I have been. The blood, it's changing me. I warned you, Lady Watcher would not be an exception. The mere smell of blood, I need to fight it constantly."

[08:59] TenderstDM: During a lull, a twitching nose appears from the burrow, drawn by a strange scent. It seems wary, but brushes the tentacle, miniscule barbs latch on and moments later the paralysing venom has taken effect. The rabbit flops down, exposed to the forest... ‚ò†Ô∏è üêá

[10:32] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him): "oh"

[10:33] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him): "maybe this rabbit can help for just now, it's not much, but it might stave off hunger for a little while"

[10:56] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): "Just 'oh'? Well, I suppose it's not screaming and running for your lives." She takes the rabbit by the scruff of the neck. "..... Thank you. Do I need to keep this thing as a pet though until I need to feed? I don't know how I feel about that..."

It sniffs at her. She scrunches her nose up at it.

[11:01] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him): "I mean, I saw how you looked at Luca and Shaun, would it not help to fill up now?"

[11:02] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): "I usually find it best to wait until the last minute. Buys you more time between feedings." She shrugs. "That's just been my experience though. Also... it's not exactly... fun, draining the life out of animals."

[11:05] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him): "I just thought that keeping satiated would stop you craving it, who knows when the last minute will be? You could be in a much worse situation, keep your strength up"

[11:05] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): She sighs. "[[Jeremiah]], it's not like food. I am always craving it."

[11:09] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him): "At least if you feed while you can you save on moments like needing to drain someone's horse to stay sane. It might not be nice but everyone in Barovia would prefer you to be far from the brink as possible."

[11:10] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): "... Understood." She devours the rabbit with a Bite attack, and drops its corpse to the ground.

[11:11] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): <Magda's timer will expire on Day 31.>

[11:12] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him): [[Jeremiah]] picks up the corpse and dusts it off, "The rest of them can still eat this, even without the blood"

[11:14] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): "I wouldn't recommend that. Leave it to rot. Honestly, most victims of vampires should be burned to prevent cross-contamination."

[11:14] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): She laughs, she seems a little blood-high. "Sorry. Old monster hunting habits."

[11:19] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him): "Ah, I suppose we should burn it, don't want Straabbit Bun Zarovich running around"

[11:31] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): "You are so lucky I'm in a good mood this morning."

[11:40] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): She looks around the area. "I don't suppose if we lit a fire here we'd end up burning the entire forest down?"

[18:29] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him): "I'll hang onto it until we can light a fire tonight, we should get back"

[19:03] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): She raises an eyebrow. "You're not going to reanimate it, are you? I feel bad enough already"
