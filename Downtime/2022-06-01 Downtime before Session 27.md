Jeremiah Templeton (he/him): *The morning, Jeremiah is waiting downstairs for the others to get up*
[16:33] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him): "Magda, can I ask about your feeding? You're in need of it, but could we just buy some chickens?"
[16:35] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him): "I know it's not the best, but if the blood doesn't have to be taken straight, we could source some donations maybe?"
[16:37] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): Magda looks more chipper than you've seen her in weeks as she prepares her bag for the day.
"Jeremiah. Good morning, I hope you slept well! ... Yes, I suppose we will need to source some chickens. My problem so far has been finding someone with disposable chickens, who won't ask questions when I come back every week for more."
[16:40] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him): Jeremiah seems emboldened by not being snapped at immediately. "Maybe we could go hunting this morning? There's no worry of not being let back in now lady Watcher is gone."
[16:41] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him): "possibly we could say we're bringing the chickens somewhere else, no one needs to know they don't make it to the destination"
[16:44] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): "That could work. I did do a similar trick once back in Castle Redis. It worked, for a few months. Eventually, the guy started thinking I was middle-manning him and wanted to know who I was selling them to, so he could sell them directly...." She zones out. "Always looking a gift horse in a mouth."
[16:45] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): "In all honesty, my plans today were to try and source some diamonds. I'm still incapable of bringing any of you back if you decide to pop your clogs." She sniffs. "For the moment at least, I still need you." She boops his nose. "But sure, we can hunt chickens."
[16:46] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him): "What do you mean, for the moment?"
[16:47] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): "A joke, dear." She hoists her rucksack onto her back. "I know I don't make them very often. I'm a little rusty."
[16:51] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him): "I mean, we're both immortal at this point, shall we go hunt this morning? I don't think Blinksy will be up for a while and he's who I would ask for diamonds"
[16:57] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): "Why not..."
[16:58] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): She gestures to the door. "Lead the way, ranger."
[17:00] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him): Jeremiah flinches slightly at ranger, but tries to shrug it off
[17:05] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): Magda looks confused. "Not taking to your new title? You were pretty handy back there with that bow, and leading us back to the path."
[17:07] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him): "Yeah, just reminds me I'm not who I want to be, who I left home to become"
[17:08] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him): "how are you doing with Varian's departure?"
[17:12] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): "Take it from an old lady. You never know what decisions will lead to the person you become. But with the benefit of hindsight... you see how inevitable everything was. It's quite freeing when you embrace it."
[17:14] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): She smarts at the sound of his name. "He's number two on my kill list. And as you know, it's a short list."
[21:13] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him): "Yeah, you hate him for it, we all do, and we'll figure out what to do about him together, but what else is it making you feel? I don't think I talked to him enough about anything, because it was hard, I don't want to make the same mistake again"
[21:18] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): Magda leans in, like she's trying to read his face. "Are you... trying to bond with me, Jerry?" She scoffs. "Is that what this is about?" She sighs. "I... I don't know. I haven't had many friends in my life. And I opened up when I got here, because the world was small now, and we seemed to have each others' backs. And it was a terrible mistake."
[21:21] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him): "Magda, without Varian we would have died many times over. Not least in that house in Barovia. If living to see today is a terrible mistake I don't want to be right"
[21:26] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): "No, I agree. We needed to work together. And we work well together... as colleagues. But that's all." She smiles. "I have big plans. And I can't do them alone. But I will keep in mind that, at the end of the day, I stand alone. No-one will catch me when I fall. Most of you probably won't even notice."
[21:28] Magdalena de Luna (she/her): "I don't know. Do you disagree? Do you feel a deep, loving kinship for us as a group? What do you want from this arrangement?"
