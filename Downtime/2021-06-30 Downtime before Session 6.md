# **NEW DOWNTIME STARTS HERE - [[VALLAKI]]**


## [[Magda]] meets the Martikov brothers while the others go to bed

[[Magda]] starts her first evening of downtime sitting in the tap room . She takes her cloak off and sits at a table by herself and catches her breath, looking up at the ceiling.

[04-Jul-21 03:33 PM] TenderstDM
After sitting for a few minutes, a woman arrives at your table with a small goblet of wine, “Welcome to [[Vallaki]] my dear, I am [[Danika]], [[Urwin]]’s wife.”

Shortly after [[Danika]] leaves the two men at the next table call out to you, “New to town, are we? And what pray tell earns you special treatment from the [[Martikovs]]?”

[04-Jul-21 04:29 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
I thank [[Danika]] for her kindness before she goes.

To the two men: "News travels fast here for such a big city, it seems. I'm afraid I don't know much about the [[Martikovs]], but we helped the young [[Viktor]] out of a sticky situation this afternoon. He found himself outside of the walls and the local... wildlife didn't seem to agree he should be there. We disagreed." She raises the goblet with a nod.

[05-Jul-21 09:49 PM] TenderstDM
One turns to the other, “Barely in town a night, and already local heroes!”
“Perhaps you will join us for a hunt someday, you'll find all manner of interesting creatures in [[Barovia]]. Better be careful though, word from the [[Vistani]] is that [[hags]] roam our valley once more. It would be a terrible thing to find yourselves the ones being hunted...”
At this the two get up to leave, “I am [[Karl]], and this is my brother [[Nikolai]], sons of [[Lady Watcher]]. We’ll be seeing you again, I’m sure.”

[05-Jul-21 10:06 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
“[[Hags]] you say? We live in dangerous times indeed…”

I reach my hand out to shake theirs as they leave. “A pleasure to meet you both, gentlemen, and my regards to [[Lady Watcher]].”

[09-Jul-21 06:22 PM] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him)
[[Jeremiah]] heads to bed straight away, and gets up in the morning looking for a hearty breakfast

[09-Jul-21 07:09 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
I think [[Magda]] would probably go to bed after finishing her wine, if only cos she can feel herself falling asleep now she's in a warm building. She says goodnight to [[Danika]] and [[Urwin]] on the way if she passes them

[12-Jul-21 08:40 AM] [[Varian]] Lo'Gosh (he/him)
[[Varian]] has gone straight to his room as well

## Downtime itinerary

[12-Jul-21 10:08 PM] TenderstDM
[[Ireena]]’s Morning:
The room is still dark when [[Ireena]] awakes – it has been another restless night. At a brisk pace, she could reach the [[Baron]]’s manor by sunrise. Perhaps she could be done with the uncomfortable pleasantries before midday. Moving for the hallway however, she senses movement on the other side of the door…

To freeze now might reveal that she had heard them. Instead, without breaking stride, she draws a blade, concealing it along the inside of her arm. With her free hand, she pushes open the door and steps forward. The corridor is long and dim, filled only with shadows. For a moment there is stillness, and then from above they are upon her. [[Ireena]] dives, rolling to the side in time to deflect a blow with her dagger. She kicks back with force throwing off her assailant. In the same moment, the door behind bursts open, a black bag is thrust over her head and the world goes dark. Heart racing, [[Ireena]] grabs out, and with considerable effort throws forward her would-be captor. She tosses aside the hood, revealing two figures ready to lunge at her once more. [[Ireena]] mutters beneath her breath, and two swords come crashing into a cloud of silvery mist. She is behind them now, her sword and dagger in hand. “You’re beaten, yield, or I will cut you down.”

The three remain still, breathing heavily, and then, without warning, the shorter of the two attackers falls forward giggling. [[Ireena]], smirks, still catching her breath. “[[Brom]] and [[Bray]] Martikov, must we do this every time I am to visit?”
“Every time until we best [[Barovia]]’s Silver Knight!” the older of the two brothers says, turning to face her, “Mother reckoned we might win this time.”
[[Ireena]] scoffs, “It will take more than games and shadows to get the better of me.”

([[Brom]] appears around 12, and his brother [[Bray]], 14 or so. In moments of excitement there is a childish glee about them, but they speak confidently to you, and work hard at their duties around the Inn.)

By the time you head downstairs, the commotion in the hallway has past and [[Ireena]] has already left for the [[Baron]]’s manor. [[Danika]] greets you and offers a simple breakfast of oats and berries.

- [[Alek]], the guard that met you and [[Viktor]] at the wall, came by late last night. He has left directions to the home of [[Freek and Myrtle]], along with 50gp as thanks from the children’s fathers.
- [[Urwin]] sits with you awhile. He speculates more about the fate of his cousin over at the vineyard, perhaps he shall investigate himself. Business has been slow, they currently only have one other staying guest, although a well-paying one. [[Danton]], the Great Performer. He’s here from Kresk to help with the [[Baron]]’s upcoming Festival of the Blazing Sun, and has become quite the local celebrity. He’s hard to pin down, but seems to frequent the toy maker [[Blinksy]]’s store - maybe you’re familiar with his wares?
- [[Danika]] suggests stopping by the church, [[Father Lucian]] knows everyone about town and could tell you [[Barovia]]’s history better than most. She also points you towards the markets, there are many stalls in the town square and shops squirrelled away down [[Vallaki]]’s cobbled streets. “Just yous be careful not to lose your feet, there’s no knowing where you might get swept off to!”

[13-Jul-21 12:36 AM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
"[[Urwin]], did you mention how far away your cousin's home is? Perhaps if we can organise arrangements for [[Danton]], we can get some time and help you investigate."

[13-Jul-21 12:08 PM] [[Arlo]] de León (he/him)
"I second that - seems a crime that a lovely establishment such as this be deprived of it's wine stock. Plus it's been a while since my last gander around a vineyard"

[[Arlo]] asks about the markets, and whether there's anyone there who he could commission to make adjustments to his handaxes. He seems in need of some silver.

[13-Jul-21 10:12 PM] TenderstDM
@[[jeremiah]] [[Urwin]] notices you looking somewhat unsatisfied with a simple breakfast of oats, he slips you a plate of glistening crisped bacon – “You look a little pale son, best be keeping some meat on those bones!”

[14-Jul-21 05:29 PM] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him)
[[Jeremiah]] with a happy stomach, thanks [[Urwin]] and says he is off to look for someone that could teach him some magic to ward off enemies

And also to speak to [[father Lucian]] about the [[abbot]] at [[Krezk]].

## [[Varian]] and [[Arlo]] go weapon shopping and meet [[Prince Rupert]]

[13-Jul-21 07:50 PM] [[Varian]] Lo'Gosh (he/him)
[[Varian]] will tag along [[Arlo]] and look for a way to silver his weapons. While walking around the market he looks for a gift for the weens, a small toy or plushie, something with a rose theme would catch his eyes!
He’ll also try to find out if there’s a thieves’ guild and how he can access it.

[13-Jul-21 10:09 PM] TenderstDM
[[Urwin]] replies, “You are mighty kind the both of you! Perhaps I worry needlessly, my cousin and his family are a capable sorts… still, I will see what more I can learn and will keep you informed.” 
“As for [[Danton]], I suspect he might be heading on his way after the festival.”

[13-Jul-21 10:11 PM] TenderstDM
Once [[Brom]] and [[Bray]] hear you are looking for toys they insist you stop by [[Blinksy]]’s, we’ll get to that after the weapons though 😊

[13-Jul-21 10:12 PM] TenderstDM
@Valdrid Usually, you would easily notice the tell-tale signs and symbols that mark the entrances to a city’s underworld. [[Vallaki]] seems strangely absent of such signs, perhaps wandering the streets you will be to hear that secret mix of dialect and jargon used to covey messages in thieves’ circles.

[15-Jul-21 09:17 PM] TenderstDM

In the heart of town you find a busy blacksmith signposted ‘The [[Authors of Iron]]’. The prices and craftsmanship appear reasonable but as you’re hanging back observing the wares you overhear two dwarves sniggering amongst themselves. To you [[Arlo]] it sounds like drunken ramblings, but [[Varian]], you pick up on the true conversation spoken in Thieve’s Cant!
“Can you believe the city guards wear this scrap? Probably looks alright to them, poor bastards…”
Subtly you let it be known that you have understood their discussion. Now usually one rogue would welcome another, but these two, they stand uneasy as they size you up, “I don’t recognise the face, but I’ll be damned if I ain’t staring into the eyes of the guard captain. Who are you Drow, and what business do you have with us here?”

[16-Jul-21 10:50 AM] [[Varian]] Lo'Gosh (he/him)
“My name is [[Varian]] and I have just recently, and unexpectedly, gotten into [[Barovia]]. It feels odd not knowing anyone about, as you probably understand. It’s a relief to hear the cant, tho! It’d be a pleasure to make your proper acquaintances and get more familiar without city. I just overheard you speaking of the low quality of this blacksmith. Would you recommend somewhere else?”

[16-Jul-21 10:59 AM] [[Varian]] Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Does the guard captain have red eyes too? *gasp*


[16-Jul-21 11:32 AM] TenderstDM
Clever [[Varian]], it seems so!
___

[17-Jul-21 11:51 AM] TenderstDM
@[[arlo]] @[[varian]] 
After a pause, one dwarf turns to the other, “Seems genuinely clueless to me, suppose there wouldn’t be any harm in sending them over to The Prince!
“If your new in town and looking for gear you won’t find finer than at [[Prince Rupert]]’s.” The two point you along your way before returning to their business.

Hidden just off the main streets you find an arched opening in the brick wall, a sweltering heat emanating from within. Entering you are greeted with a roaring voice and the sight of a Dragonborn breathing flame into his furnace, “Welcome friends, you have stumbled across ol’ Rupert’s lair!”
“Now I don’t suppose you’d be the new folks in town that saved [[Freek and Myrtle]], along with young master [[Viktor]] from a spot of bother?”
Without letting you get a word in edgewise; he excitedly brings you over to his wares. Rows of blades hang from the walls, each made from a blackened steel. 
- [[Prince Rupert]]’s weapons sell for standard prices, but imbued with dragon flame, the black steel deals magical damage.
- He’ll be happy to silver existing weapons for a third of their original price.
“And these, these here’d be the best you’ll find in all [[Barovia]], or elsewhere!” He unfurls a roll of baldes and axe heads each forged out of deep red glass. It’s taken me years to get the tempering right, but undoubtedly, they’re my finest work. The blades themselves thirst for combat; the glass edge only gets sharper with use. I call them Lifehunters.”
- [[Lifehunt]] weapons are +1 magic weapons, they go for 20gp + three times the normal weapon price. Upon hitting a target, the following attack made with the weapon gains an additional +1 to hit.

[17-Jul-21 01:27 PM] [[Varian]] Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Daggers are so cheap! A [[Lifehunt]] one would be 26gp?
I wanted to buy a standard shortsword and silver my dagger, but what’s a third of 2gp? And I might as well save for that sweet sweet [[Lifehunt]] dagger
I really think we can get [[Viktor]] to sponsor us! He could get us some of those magic weapons 🙂

[17-Jul-21 02:01 PM] TenderstDM
At least you couldn't go lower than 5! I wouldn't have you mugged for an 8!
That said, the magic store you do come across seems to sell mostly trinkets. There are dusty old books, simple charms for sale - although nothing past 1st level, and a small row of potions that look to be overpriced. By far worst of all however, is the plaque on the wall, "Fantastical Billowing Cloak: Wonder of [[Vallaki]]!"
In the cloak's place, instead a sign hangs, "SOLD".

## [[Magda]] stops by the [[Watcher Manor]]

[13-Jul-21 07:54 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
I would like to seek out [[Karl]] and [[Nikolai]] again and [[Lady Watcher]] if possible (if it’s a downtime-accessible activity) — if not, I wouldn’t mind seeing what [[Ireena]] is up to

[13-Jul-21 10:09 PM] TenderstDM
Turning to @[[magdalena]], “Now if you are looking to engage with [[Lady Watcher]], I can point you her way. Word to the wise though, there has long been tension between the Watcher and Vallakovich families, I would do my best to stay clear of that hornet’s nest.”

[13-Jul-21 10:22 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
“Thank you, friend. I will keep that in mind. I’m no stranger to old families, they collect grudges like misers hoard pennies. But I suspect we can be of use to them, and if we can do so without angering the [[Vallakoviches]], I think it would be in all of our interests. But if it is as you say… perhaps we should reunite with our young friend [[Viktor]] first, hm? 😉”

[15-Jul-21 09:18 PM] TenderstDM
“[[Viktor]]’s a troubled lad, but I get the feeling he means well. As does his farther deep down, beyond the madness that drives him now. Anyway, if you want to find [[Lady Watcher]], you’ll be best heading towards the church and then heading right off Old Svalich Road, you won’t miss her manor.”
…
Sure enough, you find the house without trouble - identifiable by its tower with a brass framed window, shaped like an eye watching over the town below. Lavishly dressed guests appear to be arriving, but a Tiefling woman stops you at the gates, “The Lady doesn’t care for you commonfolk standing and gawking – off with you now.”

[15-Jul-21 11:28 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
[[Magda]] snorts. "My goodness, it's been several lifetimes since anyone called me 'commonfolk'. 😆 Thank you for that, darling. That's made my day."

She peers over the guard's shoulder past the gates. "Tell me, is there some kind of event going on? If it's not a good time, I can come back later. I was hoping to catch [[Karl]] and [[Nikolai]], they mentioned something about a hunt to me last night? "

[17-Jul-21 11:50 AM] TenderstDM
The Tiefling woman doesn’t look kindly towards being called darling,
“The boys do like to size up new visitors in town, but that doesn’t grant you special privileges here. If you seek an audience with the Lady it will have to be through invitation - if you are indeed nobility I’m sure your welcome is already in the post…
As for hunting, an activity I feel far better suited to your sorts, there is a notice board in the town square where outings are advertised. [[Nikolai]] and [[Karl]] usually run with the wolf-catchers, but you’ll find all sorts on there. Good hunting to you.
With this she makes a show of dismissing you and returning to her post.

[17-Jul-21 03:45 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
With a shrug, [[Magda]] starts making her way back down the road.
...
Later on in the day I’d like to meet up with the others and see if we can go see [[Viktor]]

[[Magda]] is gonna have pub food for din dins once yous are all done 👀 and a wee 🍷

“Oh. Before I forget.” She puts 2 gp on the desk and slides it over to [[Varian]] for paying for the room. “With interest. Thank you for your kindness yesterday.”


## [[Jerry]] and [[Magda]] go to the church and [[Jerry]] buys The Little Book of Necromancy

[17-Jul-21 09:34 PM] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him)
Do I find any first level necromancy spells? 👀

[18-Jul-21 12:53 PM] TenderstDM
You most certainly do! You find The Little Book of Necromancy tucked away amongst the shelves,
It contains mostly edgy prose about how cool death is, and how to mix up the very best gothic eye shadow. Near the back however are 4 listed spells,
Ray of Sickness,
Inflict Wounds,
False Life,
& Cause Fear.
The book itself is only 1gp, but copying the spells into your own book will require the usual time and monetary cost!

[18-Jul-21 12:56 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
THE LITTLE BOOK OF NECROMANCY!! 😭😭❤️

[18-Jul-21 12:56 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
(Btw inflict wounds isn’t a wizard spell)

[18-Jul-21 12:57 PM] TenderstDM
Neither it is! Perhaps not so useful that one...

[18-Jul-21 01:45 PM] TenderstDM
At the church you see a familiar woman, [[Sasha]] from your travels here, talking with what looks to be the priest. They are standing just outside the church, speaking somewhat discreetly. [[Sasha]] looks far more nervous than when you met her previously, and she rushes off after handing something to the man.

[18-Jul-21 01:50 PM] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him)
I buy the little book of necromancy

Shortly after, [[Magda]] returns round the corner from [[Lady Watcher]]’s manor and sees you, @[[jeremiah]]. The two of you together are free to approach the church, although we can pick up here in game!

[18-Jul-21 02:19 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
“[[Jeremiah]]!” [[Magda]] looks flustered and distracted. “How long have you been standing there?”


[18-Jul-21 02:24 PM] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him)
"Be on the lookout for things that make you want to raise the dead, if you don't see it, pretend you see it, then raise the dead"

Just a little quote from this book I bought

[18-Jul-21 02:27 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
“That’s nice.” [[Magda]] relaxes. Slightly. “You know, I’ve met a few necromancers. You don’t seem like like a power-mad dictator. Why are you so interested in raising the dead anyway?”
