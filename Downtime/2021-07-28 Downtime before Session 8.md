If possible at night Magda would like to go find an unguarded chicken 👀

Jeremiah would also like to look for a sleeping draught as he's not been sleeping well since he arrived here

Roll an unguarded (stealth) chicken check!

You would be able to find such a thing at the same apothecary that Varian visited to identify his potions! (although on your own you wouldn't be aware of the under the table poison trade going on)

A weak sleeping draught that only aids with sleep as opposed to knocking people out would be relatively cheap, you could get a weeks supply for a couple of GP

Oh! How did this go btw? Did this happen before Varian went to [[Francis]]’?

Ah I forgot about the chicken! Got distracted by all the murder

Whilst Varian was asking about poisons, Magda noticed next door that a few crates of food were left unmanned as the heavy rain came on. Amongst them some live chickens, she could grab one then or come back during the night!

If it’s unmanned I would do it then (am I fuck doing it while all this MURDER is going on)

Can I do the like, Chicken Hypnotism thing w the line on the ground that makes them zone out, and then just carry it off to a side street

For the longest time I was trying to figure out what on earth you wanted a chicken…
