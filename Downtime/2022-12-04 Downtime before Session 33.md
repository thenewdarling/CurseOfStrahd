# Downtime - The Roof of [[Argynvostholt]]

## Magda has a change of heart (Day 29)

*[09:51] Magdalena de Luna (she/her):*

*Previously on Curse of Strahd…*

Magda is unconscious and bleeding out. Arabelle slides down off the roof, holding a life-saving potion, and poises to administer it. Ireena, still fighting off the undead lord Vladimir, reaches across and uses Lay on Hands. The Morning Lord’s righteous light flows through Magda, burning like ice even as it heals, and her eyes snap open. Arabelle stands over her, and Magda sees the fear in her eyes, sees an arrow fly overhead—

They move, in perfect sync, back to back, as they unleash powerful cantrips to incinerate the archers.

Magda stands, catching her breath, still roiling.

*[[Sasha]], scrabbling at her face as she dies in her arms.*

*Varian, standing over Arlo’s body. His words: “We all have our trials to overcome, hold onto what you believe in.”*

*Jeremiah’s face, the shock, the betrayal, as the portal is closed in his face.*

*And Magda, sitting in that fucking chair. The hubris. Strahd’s hand on her shoulder, delicate as brushing a cobweb. A single word, and she’d been enthralled. All her will, all her bluster, had been nothing. She may as well have been shouting at the tides.*

And when she’d dropped this time, there had been nothing. No-one on the other side. Not even Asmodeus. Only darkness. Only her friends, fighting to keep her up even while she wasn’t there to see it…

“I’ve been a fool.”

*And now… in downtime:*

Magda turns, and grabs Arabelle in a hug. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”



*[10:07] Arabelle (she/her):*
Arabelle is taken by surprise, adrenaline still pumping through her veins after the battle. At first she tenses up, afraid, not knowing what’s happening. Then, hearing the pain and regret in Magda’s voice, she relaxes and hugs her back. “It’s ok. You’re ok. We got you.”

*[18:04] Magdalena de Luna (she/her):*

Magda clutches the back of Arabelle's head in her hug as she catches her breath. "A fool. A fool. A fool," she whispers to herself.

And then she breaks the hug. Her face is stained with tears and muck and blood. She makes no attempt to wipe any of it away. "If Varian hurt me when I left, it's only because he did what I would have done. What I expected we all would do, in that situation. But I was wrong. I think..." She takes a breath, ragged and vulnerable. "I still thought I could do this alone. If I needed you, it was only as a tool. But I was wrong."

She looks down at the empty healing potion in her hand, the sparkling red dregs circling the bottom of the jar. And then... a smirk breaks through. Then a chuckle. Then a laugh, rising in pitch, fuelled by endorphins, unhinged. "My husband used to say to me, a *long* time ago..." She deepens her voice and puffs out her chest in an impression of a very serious man. "*'Magda. Your problem is you never know when you are beaten.'*" She laughs again, a witch's cackle. "I used to think, 'Yeah. I don't. And that's why I'm still standing here and you're in the ground.' But he was right. The old bastard was right." Still laughing, she hurls the healing potion bottle off the roof of the fort, watches it disappear into the mists. "Well. I know now. I am beaten. And bruised. And broken." 

She takes a deep breath like a weight has been lifted from her, and says absently, "We need to find Jeremiah, he's probably being eaten by bears as we speak." And then, she takes Arabelle's hands. "I promise to do better. And to treat you all as the treasures I have been blessed with. Because without you all, I wouldn't be here."

*[06:23] Arabelle (she/her):*

Arabelle looks around at what is left of the once fearsome and noble Silver Knights, their fortress crumbling away. The destruction, death and sorrow all around her. “Maybe being away from home, facing danger, seeing my life flash before my eyes… it forces some introspection, doesn’t it?” She smiles, an impish spark in her eyes. “Or maybe I’ve always been this wise, and have been playing you all along. Biding my time. I saw you on the road, knew what you were, what destinies awaits you.” Her eyes glaze over, staring into the distance. “And how you keep defying and changing them.” She focuses back on Magda, her wicked smile back. “And I am now part of it.”

*[08:46] Magdalena de Luna (she/her):*

"That you are. We'd be lost without you." Magda squeezes Arabelle's shoulder, before turning to Ireena. "And thank you for the assist. I would've been a goner. In the interest of my new-found honesty, I think... we need to rest. Hm?" She turns to the whole group. "I don't know about you but I've been running on fumes since before Castle Ravenloft."

*[08:54] Arabelle (she/her):*

“I know you’re tired, but we still have to go find this guy’s tomb. We have the key now, can’t be that hard, right?”

*[09:34] Magdalena de Luna (she/her):*

"Yes, famously the heart of the tomb _doesn't_ hold the most powerful locked-away creatures," Magda snickers, but she's resigned. "Okay. What's once more unto the breach, hm? But I warn you... my strength is spent." But she looks down, as she feels a warmth around her hip. The symbol of Asmodeus on her sword, the hilt of Traitor itself, glows imperceptibly. Only for a moment. She wouldn't even have seen it if it hadn't been so dark on the roof. And she wonders if maybe she's just tapped into a new reserve she hadn't known... "Okay. For you my dears, we ride." And she pulls the sword from her belt.
