# Downtime - The Roof of [[Argynvostholt]]

## Magda has a change of heart (Day 29)

*Previously on Curse of Strahd…*

Magda is unconscious and bleeding out. Arabelle slides down off the roof, holding a life-saving potion, and poises to administer it. Ireena, still fighting off the undead lord Vladimir, reaches across and uses Lay on Hands. The Morning Lord’s righteous light flows through Magda, burning like ice even as it heals, and her eyes snap open. Arabelle stands over her, and Magda sees the fear in her eyes, sees an arrow fly overhead—

They move, in perfect sync, back to back, as they unleash powerful cantrips to incinerate the archers.

Magda stands, catching her breath, still roiling.

*Sasha, scrabbling at her face as she dies in her arms.*

*Varian, standing over Arlo’s body. His words: “We all have our trials to overcome, hold onto what you believe in.”*

*Jeremiah’s face, the shock, the betrayal, as the portal is closed in his face.*

*And Magda, sitting in that fucking chair. The hubris. Strahd’s hand on her shoulder, delicate as brushing a cobweb. A single word, and she’d been enthralled. All her will, all her bluster, had been nothing. She may as well have been shouting at the tides.*

And when she’d dropped this time, there had been nothing. No-one on the other side. Not even Asmodeus. Only darkness. Only her friends, fighting to keep her up even while she wasn’t there to see it…

“I’ve been a fool.”

*And now… in downtime:*

Magda turns, and grabs Arabelle in a hug. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”
