## Stella gives [[Magda]] a surprise birthday gift (Day 25)

[19:25] TenderstDM: In the early hours of the morning, [[Stella]] stops by the Inn, searching for [[Magda]].

“Your name, it sounded so familiar to me. Forgive me, but I looked through my mother’s old records of nobility, and there you were, [[Magdalena]] de Luna. How you are here after all this time…
It had your birth date, and well, happy birthday. Blinksy helped me engrave it.”

She reaches out her hand, offering a silver ring marked with the seal of [[Iliadvar]].

[23:52] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her): [[Magda]] holds the ring in her hand, memories swimming. “This means… more than you know, young lady.” She thumbs the seal of [[Iliadvar]] with her thumb. “It… if I didn’t know any better, I would say this was my original engagement ring.” She works it onto her wedding ring finger, and wraps the girl in a hug. “Now that day… that was a story. Those poor bridesmaids…” She disengages, and holds her ring finger in her hand, feeling the weight of the ring. She laughs. “Goodness. I’d forgotten there was a day before I took his name. His seal.” She smiles at Stella. “Thank you. And pass my thanks to Blinksy.”

[19:35] [[Arabelle]] (she/her): [[Arabelle]] is eating her breakfast at a close by table, and can’t help but overhear the conversation. She stands up and moves towards [[Magda]], casting druidcraft to create a crown of red roses.
“Oh [[Magda]], happy birthday!” she places the crown on [[Magda]]’s head. “My mum always said we are queen’s of the day on our birthday, and deserve a crown to show it. Red really suits you.”

[13:13] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her): [[Magda]], completely unable to avoid Further Birthday Conversation, coughs. “Th… thank you.” She puts the roses on her head. If she could blush, she would.

She runs her finger over the ring again. “So much has changed…” she says to herself. “Oh, if the dead could speak, yes?”

[17:37] [[Arabelle]] (she/her): [[Arabelle]] shivers visibly, her eyes glazing over, and whispers “But sometimes they do…”
She shakes herself back into focus. “Brr! Speaking of which.”
She turns to [[Stella]], “Lady Watcher, I haven’t introduced myself. My name is [[Arabelle]], I have a farm just outside [[Krezk]] and have joined [[Magda]] and the others in their adventures. 
“I… have visions, sometimes, and they’re never very clear. But they’ve been getting more frequent and… disturbing.” she says, her face growing more concern as she speaks.
“I had one this morning, of the Captain of the Guard, in that recent fire, with the bodies.”
She eyes Stella, looking for recognition of the event. Gathering some courage, she puffs herself up and puts on a serious face. “More pain and destruction is brewing, Lady Watcher. I want to help!”
 
[18:27] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her): [[Magda]] looks worried. "What do you mean, bodies?"

[18:31] [[Arabelle]] (she/her): "There was a fire two nights ago, at one of the houses up the hill. One of the ones marked with a silver eye..." [[Arabelle]] shifts from foot to foot, looking uncomfortable. "Three bodies were found."

[18:59] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her): "Oh no, that's horrible... There's still that level of violence in the city? I know you'd said that there was unrest, Stella, but I didn't think people were still being killed." [[Magda]] adjusts her rose crown. "[[Arabelle]] is right, anything we can do to help."

[19:05] [[Arabelle]] (she/her): [[Arabelle]]'s eyes glaze over again, she looks into the middle distance, recalling her vision. "There was more to my vision... I saw a woman, a half-elf, speaking to a crowd. They were at an inn... The sign was of a knight's helm, severed, bleeding... The woman name's was very clear in the vision. [[Mordesh]]."

[19:07] [[Arabelle]] (she/her): "I would greatly appreciate your help, [[Magda]]. You are respected here, I am no one. Would you come find the Captain with me?"

[19:10] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her): "Please. If you were no-one I would not be speaking to you." She smiles. "Of course." She takes Stella by the hand once more. "Thank you again for the ring. It... shone a light on the events of the last few days."

*[[Eden]] slithers in through the window, resummoned with Find Familiar.*

[21:35] [[Arabelle]] (she/her): Stella squeezes [[Magda]]'s hand, smiling. "I am glad you enjoyed the gift." She looks at [[Arabelle]], bows her head in recognition.
"Although I am Lady Watcher, that name carries a weight that I don't care for. Please, call me Stella.
"Yes, I have heard of tensions rising in the city. Those who stood with my mother, who either approved of her plans or were too scared to oppose her, are now being targeted. My mother made it easy for them, marking their doors with her sigil.
"That inn you saw in your vision, I'm sure you mean the Knight's Head. Please, go find Alek and tell him what you saw."
