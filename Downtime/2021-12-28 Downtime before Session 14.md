# Downtime - The Night of the Masquerade

[30-Dec-21 11:44 AM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Magda hovers over the [[Lady Watcher]]’s body. “What do I do?” she asks the party. “I know what I want to do, what my blood is screaming for constantly, but I’ve learned to ignore it. So what’s the right thing to do? And why would he do this?”

[31-Dec-21 03:49 PM] Arlo de León (he/him)
“I’m not sure what kinda effects this bloodlust thing has on you, Magda, but what I do know is that I’d much rather [[Lady Watcher]]'s neck be on the line than those poor buggers down there”

“I think it would be wise to play Mr Strahds game for a while, until we’re ready to pay him back his dues”

[31-Dec-21 03:52 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
“We are rats on his operating table.” She rattles her fingers off the desk. “Normally my impulse right about now is to flip the table over completely. As it is, I don’t even know what that would look like…”

“Why do I get the feeling this is the bait….. and there’s a hook coming?”

[31-Dec-21 03:55 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
“Exactly my thoughts. If [[Strahd]] has this kind of power over [[Sasha]], what’s to say he won’t have it over you once you drink [[Lady Watcher]]’s blood? Is this a risk we can take?”


[31-Dec-21 03:56 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
“But those are innocent people dying downstairs. Is [[Lady Watcher]]’s life worth more than theirs?”


[31-Dec-21 03:59 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
“I don’t see why he couldn’t just do that to me now though. [[Strahd]] is stronger than any vampire I’ve met and I’m barely subsisting on chickens.”


[31-Dec-21 03:59 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
“…. we couldn’t take her at our current skill level. It would folly to try…” She thinks about it. “Would it?”


[31-Dec-21 04:03 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
“Take [[Sasha]] out?” Varian looks at the party, noticing everyone’s wounds, “I don’t think we could.”


[31-Dec-21 04:06 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
Magda looks around the room, at each of them in turn. “This is such a bad idea….” But she gets up.


[31-Dec-21 04:09 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
She leans over the [[Lady Watcher]]’s body, and whispers something in her ear.

||”I have not drank human blood in over half a century. I have tried to be good. But for you, you wicked hag, I will make an exception.”||

It is quick, and gory, and visceral. Bits of throat splatter across the table, arterial spray in a fountain, then down to a splutter. Magda stands, eyes like pinpricks, drenched in red.

She wipes her lips with the back of her hand, and then slurps the wipings. “How… quickly I forget,” she says to herself. She’s laughing. Breathless. She just stands in a moment in it, closing her eyes. The [[Lady Watcher]] crumbles into dust on the table. 

Magda opens her eyes. She’s looking at the party now. Like she’s still lost in the sauce. 

Like she’s still hungry.

Arlo removes a handkerchief from his sleeve, and holds it out to Magda

“Red is your colour, my dear”

She twitches, looks at the handkerchief, and grabs Arlo by the wrist. But it’s like when you have too much sugar at once and your muscles suddenly go weak, and it gives her a second to think. Her eyes return to normal. “Arlo.”


[31-Dec-21 04:15 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
She rips the handkerchief out of his hand. “That was very misguided of you.”

(I need to quickly confirm exactly what I can do now w Liam cos I’m just going off the #deleted-channel and I’m giving Liam a chance to change anything that’s not right)

Jeremiah's pacing the room, lost in thought, when Arlo speaks first, he mutters, annoyed, "drink [[lady watcher]]'s blood, obviously" then goes back to deep thought and pacing, increasingly panicked

For a moment the church falls still, and then the catacomb’s door creaks open. At first a few townsfolk emerge, exhausted from their attempts to break the lock, and then the rest come. Battered and wounded, slowly they trickle out, a seemingly unending sea of broken faces. [[Father Lucian]] begins to guide people out into the street, cautiously at first, but it appears the city is quiet, apart from the sound of rain.

As the crowd thins, a bat escapes, flapping madly before taking off through a shattered window. And then the final figures emerge - **and the dice are rolled.**

[[Dargos]] Weerdo limps past, he manages to catch your eye and asks you to come see him before leaving town.

[[Alek]] is the last of the guards to come up, helping carry the wounded, “five dead he says… well, five in the catacombs, many more in the streets.”

[[Prince Rupert]] follows behind, cradling the body of [[Urwin]] Martikov. 
“One moment she was crying with her head in her hands, the next she came at us hungry and snarling. [[Father Lucian]] was a fool to take [[Sasha]] in, all vampires belong to their master… [[Urwin]] was barely back on his feet before he gave the last of his life, protecting the townsfolk down there”. 
The Dragonborn cannot cry, but the pain is clear in [[Prince Rupert]]’s eyes.

Nobody seems keen to stay inside for long, and soon you are alone in the broken hall. A faint blue glow emanates from an amulet in the ash where [[Fiona]]’s body lay, the same you saw her clutching before she was overcome by shadows.

[[Blinksy]] remains at the door, staring out. The church grounds are a mess of rubble and embers, no trace of the vampire spawn remains. In the dim light of the afternoon, the Eye of the [[Watcher manor]] gazes down over the town. Able townsfolk and the remaining guards tend to the wounded and start clearing the streets.

*In the direction of the [[Baron]]’s home, wisps of smoke can be seen in the distance.*

Well, first -- I pull the amulet from the [[Lady Watcher]]'s henry hoover bag


[03-Jan-22 06:35 PM] Magdalena de Luna (she/her)
I'd like to give it a quick visual inspection


[03-Jan-22 06:36 PM] Jeremiah Templeton (he/him)
When I have time to do it as a ritual, I cast Identify on it

(And then shall we make haste to the Vallakovitch manor?)


[04-Jan-22 06:35 AM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
(I think we really should!)


[04-Jan-22 06:41 AM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian gives Blinky’s shoulder a squeeze and smiles tentatively at him, “You did well, [[Blinksy]].”
Seeing the wisps of smoke in the distance, Varian curses under his breath, “[[Viktor]]!” and urges the party to come quickly.

As we run to the Manor, I'm casting message frantically at where [[Viktor]] would be (range 120feet, can go through solid objects if I'm familiar with the target)

Basically running along muttering "[[Viktor]], where are you?" the whole way


[04-Jan-22 01:10 PM] Arlo de León (he/him)
(Just to add to this bit as I forgot to reply!) Arlo flinches when Magda grabs his wrist, but quickly recovers and levels her with an earnest look. “I wouldn’t have become who I am without dancing with darkness occasionally. You have that darkness, but also a lot of light. Life is about balance” he looks at Magdas blood drenched form, and then meets her eyes meaningfully, “and moderation”

As you approach the [[Baron]]’s manor, you can hear the fire hissing violently in the rain. The whole place is ablaze, and the front of the house has been completely blown to pieces. Nobody inside could still be alive.

As you stand staring, a hand reaches out touching your shoulder. You turn to see [[Viktor]], his mum and [[Stella]] beside him. [[Viktor]] falls forward, sobbing in your arms.
“Our home… our home is gone. And my father. My father is dead…”
[[Lydia]] Vallakovich looks to you all, “A guard came to warn us, [[Karl]] Watcher approached the manor, full of rage and madness. He tore the house apart with fireballs, with us inside. He meant for us to die.”
“But [[Viktor]] saved us!” [[Stella]] steps forward, taking hold of [[Viktor]]’s hand, “He did it. His circle worked and it transported us to the edge of town. Had you not healed him, we all would have perished.”

[[Stella]] shakes a little, and it seems the tremendous weight of the day falls upon each of you.
Something brushes past your legs, and you look down to see a familiar cat, its rightful mind finally returned.

You have worked hard for this [[Fiona]] - I trust you will not disappoint me.
