## During a night watch, [[Magda]] and [[Jeremiah]] discuss his zombification

[10-Jan-22 04:01 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
While [[Magda]] is preparing the campfire, surreptitiously: "You're not looking well, [[Jeremiah]]. And I'm noticing that salve I keep making you is having less and less of an effect. How do you feel?"

[10-Jan-22 05:25 PM] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him)
"What? No, it's working fine, I don't think Borovia agrees with me is all. I'm sure everyone feels the same."

[[Jeremiah]] rolls out his bed and climbs in "Goodnight [[Magda]]"

[10-Jan-22 05:28 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
[[Magda]] waits for [[Varian]] to go past before whispering into the bedroll. "Does [[Arlo]] look like he's wasting away? Does [[Varian]]? And there's..." She groans. "Listen, just trust me. I'm a cleric. I can sense something off with you. It's getting worse."

[10-Jan-22 05:36 PM] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him)
"I'm just not as strong as them, you've all been going out adventuring for years, I've been mopping floors all my life" He turns over in his bed roll. "How do you even know what I'm supposed to be like? Have you ever even met another half-goblin?"

[10-Jan-22 05:39 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
"If I'm going to be honest with you, I didn't know they existed until I met you." She takes a deep breath. "Ninth Circle, you're going to make me say it." She makes sure no-one is listening.

[10-Jan-22 05:41 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
"[[Jeremiah]], I can see people's heartbeats. I can hear their blood pounding. Ever since [[Lady Watcher]], I have to keep reminding myself that you're all still people, that you're not just bags of blood to drain. Even my friends." She looks up at [[Arlo]] and [[Varian]] across the campsite. "But not you. There's something wrong with your blood, I can smell it. Like you'd give me food poisoning. And it's getting worse."

"You can't keep pretending it's not happening. I've seen it before. Someone buries their head in the sand until they're growing fangs. I don't want to kill you [[Jeremiah]]. We have to deal with this."

[10-Jan-22 05:46 PM] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him)
"What do you expect me to do [[Magda]]? We're already going to Kresk, do you want me to lie awake at night worrying? I've followed every lead as best I can, the only thing I could have done better was to abandon the [[bonegrinder]] and [[Vallaki]]"

[10-Jan-22 05:49 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
"No-one except you knows how bad it's getting. And you just tried to tell me it was just because you were tired. Our current plan is to stop on the way to Kresk. Because you won't communicate. Should we bypass the tower and head straight to Kresk?" She shrugs. "I have no idea. Because you won't talk about it."

[10-Jan-22 05:54 PM] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him)
"Frankly, I was telling the truth then, but you know, rotting blood and all that changed my mind. Let's talk about it in the morning, you're not getting me to stay up through your shift that easily" He manages a slight smile then turns back over

[10-Jan-22 05:58 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
She smiles. "Sure. You watch out for me, I'll watch out for you. Us infected have to stick together." She stirs the fire, and looks over to the others just going to bed. Watching their pulses slow in the dark as they relax. As they let their guards down. She pauses... and then shakes herself to remind her of who she is, and what she isn't.
