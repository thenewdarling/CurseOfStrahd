# Downtime - [[The Winery]]

## [[Arlo]] requests training from [[Van Richten]] (Day 31)

[10:05] _Arlo de Le√≥n (he/they)_:

Arlo is going to approach Van Richten. "Hello, old chap" He places a hand on his shoulder and gives him a warm, bittersweet smile. "I must say you've certainly looked better...which is why i'm hesitant to ask, but i need a favour" A hopeful smirk. "Do you feel well enough to spar with me?"

Arlo explains that he feels ill-prepared for the coming days, and is worried that his lack of tactical know-how will let his friends down when it comes to it. He's not a healer. All he's known is being the charming brute, not one for the helping of others. But he cares about this unlikely group they've gathered, and see's how they support each other in battle. It's no longer enough that this group is the vessel that will bring him back to his Allessandra, to his life of luxury in his stately home - he can't bear to see them hurt anymore. 

"I want to learn some kind of _Bait and Switch_ maneuver. A way to get my friends out of harms way, so that the melee range of foes no longer traps them. I brag about my girth and hardiness a lot, but its worth nothing if it can't be used to take the brunt for someone less armoured. Will you practice with me?" 

*(Arlo would like to attempt to learn the Bait and Switch manuever - if the DM permits!) When you're within 5 feet of a creature on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and switch places with that creature, provided you spend at least 5 feet of movement and the creature is willing and isn't incapacitated. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Roll the superiority die. Until the start of your next turn, you or the other creature (your choice) gains a bonus to AC equal to the number rolled.)*
