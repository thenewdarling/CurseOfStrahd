# Downtime - [[The Winery]]

## [[Arlo]] requests training from [[Van Richten]] (Day 31)

[10:05] _Arlo de León (he/they)_:

Arlo is going to approach Van Richten. "Hello, old chap" He places a hand on his shoulder and gives him a warm, bittersweet smile. "I must say you've certainly looked better...which is why i'm hesitant to ask, but i need a favour" A hopeful smirk. "Do you feel well enough to spar with me?"

Arlo explains that he feels ill-prepared for the coming days, and is worried that his lack of tactical know-how will let his friends down when it comes to it. He's not a healer. All he's known is being the charming brute, not one for the helping of others. But he cares about this unlikely group they've gathered, and see's how they support each other in battle. It's no longer enough that this group is the vessel that will bring him back to his Allessandra, to his life of luxury in his stately home - he can't bear to see them hurt anymore. 

"I want to learn some kind of _Bait and Switch_ maneuver. A way to get my friends out of harms way, so that the melee range of foes no longer traps them. I brag about my girth and hardiness a lot, but its worth nothing if it can't be used to take the brunt for someone less armoured. Will you practice with me?" 

*(Arlo would like to attempt to learn the Bait and Switch manuever - if the DM permits!) When you're within 5 feet of a creature on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and switch places with that creature, provided you spend at least 5 feet of movement and the creature is willing and isn't incapacitated. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Roll the superiority die. Until the start of your next turn, you or the other creature (your choice) gains a bonus to AC equal to the number rolled.)*

## [[Arlo]] receives a gift (Day 31)

*[22:43]Magdalena de Luna (she/her):*

While @Arlo de León (he/they) is doing drills against a dummy in the courtyard, Magda approaches.

She holds out an envelope, covered in cursive font in the writing of multiple hands. "We may not get any more time to do this. I know you had said you weren't ready before, so I give you this for when you are."

The envelope is scented with orange blossom, sealed in rich red wax.

"It's a *Spell Scroll of Sending*. I had Arabelle and Neander help me make it." She looks visibly uncomfortable at giving gifts to people. "All you have to do is break the seal and your wife will hear you, I promise." 

She looks at the envelope in her hand. "Twenty-five words, Arlo. Make them count. It's not much, but it's the best I can do before we get you home."

*[11:37]Arlo de León (he/they):*

Arlo takes the envelope gingerly, like it’s something precious. He looks at Magda with wet eyes. “I will, dear. I will make them count. Thank you Magda…this is…I don’t have the words. It’s very kind of you. Of you all.” He carefully places the envelope in the jacket pocket over his heart, with Blinksy’s doll. He makes a movement like he wants to give her a hug, but is worried that wouldn’t be well received. Instead he reaches out and squeezes her hand, looks at her sincerely and hopes that she can see his gratitude in his watery eyes.


*[12:03]Magdalena de Luna (she/her):*

She pulls the squeezed hand into giving him a hug. It's a little too tight to be affectionate, more like a hug between two soldiers. "You're the best of us, Arlo. We're all counting on you, and you can count on us. Let's get you all home." 

And with that, she excuses herself.

## [[Jenny]] has a dream (Night of Day 30)

*[11:09]Magdalena de Luna (she/her)_:_*

Jenny Greentooth had not dreamt so smoothly in years. Fluffy, plump things, like whipped cream. She had grown so used to her dreams having to travel through fourteen layers of dimensional Berezian maze, a tiramisu in her subconscious.

She hadn't eaten tiramisu in so long. She was sitting in a little cafe in Vallaki, one that had closed centuries ago. The tiny round table was so weighed down by treats that it threatened to tip over.

She was tucking into the tallest slice of apple pie she'd ever seen in her life, when she realised someone was sitting on the iron-wrought chair opposite her.

"Do you mind?" she spat. She paused to swallow her delicious apple pie before any more of it spilled out of her mouth. "I'm busy!"

He was old, decrepit. He was struggling to get air, like his lungs were full of holes. "Jenny?"

"Yes? What is it?" Jenny said. "I don't know you. What are you doing in my dream? You're going to ruin it!"

"I need your help."

Jenny quirked her eyebrow, stroked the little beard on her chinny-chin-chin. "What will you give me?" Her eyes sparkled with wickedness.

"Magdalena," the old geezer said, lurching forward in his chair. "Lake Zarovich." He clutched a dessert spoon from the table with a hand that held no strength anymore. With intense effort, he started to carve shapes into a custard tart in the middle of the table.

Jenny looked at the tart suspiciously. "That's a teleportation circle pattern."

He finally finished, dropping the spoon on the table and leaning back as though he'd run a marathon. "Magdalena. Lake Zarovich. Please. Bring her."

"Hmmmmm..." Jenny narrowed her eyes at him. "I'll think about it."

And she took her spoon right to the middle of the tart.
