#### *The party have stopped in the [[Vistani camp]] to take a long rest of 24 hours*

[01-Jun-21 02:08 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
After failing to get his lock of hair back from [[Radu]] and the enigmatic readings of [[Madame Eva]], Varian feels frustrated and trapped. [[Rose]], now a constant voice in his mind prompting him to go and live a little, encourages him to rest and make the most out of this time, which to him means one thing only - gather as much intel as possible. With [[Rose]] as a second pair of eyes, Varian explores the camp and tries to talk with people.
The first and most obvious piece of information he is looking for is  on the wondering Vistani the cards told us to look for. What is her name, who is the mentor she looks for, if anyone has an idea on how to find her.
Secondly, if someone has any knowledge of a wizard’s tower on a lake, and any history associated to it.
Thirdly, he looks for any advice on surviving this new landscape. What herbs, berries, wildlife to avoid and what could be helpful.
And finally, if people have ever seen a ghostly knight on a horse roaming around, or if there are legends of one.

As Varian explores the [[Vistani camp]], he spots [[Radu]]. Still bitter about him rigging the game, he sends [[Rose]], in her invisible form, to spy on him for a couple of games and see if she can tell how [[Radu]] tricks people. After that, once [[Radu]] retires for the night, she'll follow him and try to find out where he'd keep Varian's and [[Magda]]'s hair strands.

[01-Jun-21 08:59 PM] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him)
[[Jeremiah]] seeks out [[Magda]] after a good sleep to discuss infusing a balm with lesser restoration. After, he mulls around the camp chatting with people and asking if they know anywhere he could learn magic or anyone he could learn it from.

[01-Jun-21 09:06 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
Do we know how long the balm keeps for? If you have five days worth of balm, it might be almost a week before you actually touch the next batch
If time is no issue, I will make a point of preparing a balm to cast Lesser Restoration on the moment my spells slots come back


[02-Jun-21 01:05 PM] TenderstDM
The morning after [[Madame Eva]]’s reading, Varian and [[Jeremiah]] awake with an extra hit dice of temporary hit points (as these are acquired during your long rest, they will carry into the following days). [[Ireena]] introduces the group to [[Arlo]], and explains that her prophecy from [[Madame Eva]]’s, includes the four of you. As such [[Ireena]] wants you to prepare yourself as best you can. “Go acquire whatever you may need to travel, it is three days ride to Vallaki, and the roads in Barovia are always treacherous.” She hands each of you 25gp.

@thenewdarling  Nobody in the camp knows of where you might acquire a diamond outside of Vallaki, thankfully this is where you are heading. Although most of the Vistani carry arms, it takes you a while to find someone willing to trade a rapier. A young woman has recently acquired some wares, she has a silvered rapier and dagger, worth 40gp and 25gp to her respectively – or an item of suitable worth to trade!

[02-Jun-21 01:14 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
([[Magda]] makes sure to say hello to [[Arlo]] before going to the young woman - presumably quite business-like about the whole thing)
Valuing her shortsword at 15gp, she offers to trade both it and the 25gp from [[Madame Eva]] for the silvered rapier

[02-Jun-21 01:26 PM] [[Arlo]] de León (he/him)
[[Arlo]] greets everyone cheerfully, with a bow. He’s still not entirely clicked that here’s stuck here, and is enjoying the ambiance. He seeks someone out to tell him about the Vistani and Boravia in general

[02-Jun-21 01:42 PM] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him)
[[Jeremiah]] at first flinches at [[Arlo]]'s greeting, then realising that he's just bending, and not shooting arrows, he also greets [[Arlo]]

[02-Jun-21 01:57 PM] TenderstDM
She's happy to receive your interest, but has no need for your sword. She stumbled into these items, maybe if you offered to take both the dagger and rapier of her hands she could do you a deal?

[02-Jun-21 02:05 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
"I'd be happy to, but I don't have much more to offer unfortunately. I have 32gp to my name, and if other weapons are not your fancy, what did you have in mind?"

(If anyone else is nearby who's interested in the dagger:) "Perhaps we could pool our resources? I don't know if any of you are particularly interested in this butter knife - shiny though it may be. Hm, I suppose it could cleave a zombie skull if thrown hard enough. It is tipped with silver, after all."

[02-Jun-21 02:29 PM] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him)
Is the dagger silvered too? [[Jeremiah]] already has a dagger, but a silvered one would be an upgrade

[02-Jun-21 04:14 PM] TenderstDM
It is! They're both pretty ornate, the dagger has a small red gem stone embedded in its handle and the rapier has an intricate gold hand guard

“I could do you them both for 50gp! Else you have something suitably exciting to keep the wee ones entertained, they’re always asking for one of those [[Blinksy]] dolls from town!”


[05-Jun-21 01:22 PM] TenderstDM
@UsernameOfRassilon @thenewdarling Father [[Rurick]]’s note shows a slightly more complicated process than he let on, perhaps mundane to him now after years of practice. At least there is no indication expiration will be an issue…
The salve requires: bee’s wax + water taken from holy ground + 4 hours downtime to imbue with minor restoration (DC12 WIS check for success). Multiple batches can be attempted at a time.

A Vistani cleric is willing to sell holy water for 5gp, enough for three batches. He believes the only one capable of a more permanent cure would be the [[abbot]] at [[Krezk]].

@UsernameOfRassilon  Asking around you find the Vistani people do have a little magic in their blood. An animal friendship spell is widely known, and teachable to friendly strangers that know how to dance. Some of the camp elders know how to bestow curses upon less friendly travellers - it would take a great gesture of trust before they’d consider teaching this to an outsider.

@varian  @[[arlo]]  In search of details about your strange surroundings, you find yourself directed towards the camp elders. From them you find,
-    The Vistani people have always called Barovia their home, their ancestors once helped [[Strahd]] when he was still human, lost and injured in their valley. It is for this past kindness that he offers the Vistani temporary leave from the mists. Their deal now is for protection, and in return they draw more souls to Barovia.
-    The Martikov family are worth seeking out in Vallaki, they are good people. The mayor on the other hand is an unhinged man, his best intentions twisted by fear. There is a great deal of unrest in the city.
-    Avoid the wildlife, period. The zombies in Barovia are infused with a greater evil than those created by traditional necromancy, this is the work of the witches in [[Berez]] to the south.
-    If you’re on the lookout for poisons, Corpse Flowers grow down by the water, the kids know not to touch them. "Poison is the least of our worries these days though, many children have gone missing over the last month. Distressingly there are many possible culprits, a small hunting party is out investigating the cause, they were due back yesterday…"

[05-Jun-21 01:39 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
“That’s very kind of you ma’am, @UsernameOfRassilon I believe you said you were interested in this dagger?”

“I don’t suppose you have a spell in that book of yours that summons bees?”

[05-Jun-21 11:12 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian tries to find out more about the missing children. Who are the other possible culprits? Where did the hunting party leave for? Wouldn’t it be in [[Strahd]]’s best interest to keep the children safe, even if only for keeping those who leave Barovia liable to come back? So does he offer any help?

[06-Jun-21 06:08 PM] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him)
Priority one: where in the nine hells is [[krezk]]? This will tell me how much holy water I need.
Side note how many days per batch?

Priority 2: what do the elders who can curse people think of [[Radu]]? Would they like him gone or do they love him?

Priority 3 animal friendship

Priority 2.5:ever seen a mage tower?

[06-Jun-21 06:31 PM] TenderstDM
3-4 days ride west of Vallaki! (Vallaki itself is about 3-4 days ride from the [[Vistani camp]])

[06-Jun-21 06:32 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
Ok so like 6-8 days in the same direction we’re going anyway? 😮

[06-Jun-21 06:32 PM] TenderstDM
The elders are largely indifferent to [[Radu]], some have a mild dislike of him, others find his antics amusing

[06-Jun-21 06:34 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
Does 1 batch of balm do you for 1 day? I had a memory the one [[rurick]] gave us was enough for more

[06-Jun-21 06:39 PM] TenderstDM
Yeah, by batch, I mean enough for a single day 🙂 [[Rurick]] gave you around 5 batches worth

[06-Jun-21 09:43 PM] [[Arlo]] de León (he/him)
A sucker for silver, zombie cleaving, and chivalry, [[Arlo]] offers to pool his resources and get [[Magdalena]] the dagger "I have 29gp to my name currently, would that suffice? It would be a shame to let such a pretty weapon go to waste, and Allessandra is sure to reimburse me once we are reunited"

[06-Jun-21 09:51 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
"I don't actually need the dagger, the deal for getting them both at the same time is just hard to pass up on! I'll tell you what, lover boy. If you loan me 18gp, I can cover the cost of both. I'll pay you back when more gold flows in, and you can hang onto the dagger in the meantime. And if you can put it in the back of an undead, all the better for all of us."

[06-Jun-21 09:57 PM] [[Arlo]] de León (he/him)
"How diplomatic of you, and incredibly sweet. No need to pay me back, my dear, the dagger is payment alone - and if we are to be travelling together for a bit, i assure you it will be most effective in my hands." [i hand you 18gp]

[06-Jun-21 10:01 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
"Much appreciated. It seems chivalry isn't dead after all. Or.... undead?"

[06-Jun-21 10:04 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
@Liam With [[Magda]]'s 32gp and [[Arlo]]'s 18gp, we buy the rapier and the dagger!! 👍 ([[Jeremiah]]'s gonna do an Identify before we equip them tho in case they're cursed or whatever lol)

[06-Jun-21 10:10 PM] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him)
I spend 15gp on the holy water and cast identify on them and the weapons and the coin

[10-Jun-21 07:18 PM] TenderstDM
"Sold!" The Vistani woman happily parts with her silvered weapons, even watching with interest as [[Jeremiah]] checks them for curses. Both are safe - and razor sharp.

[10-Jun-21 07:19 PM] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him)
I'm identifying hidden in my tent!

[10-Jun-21 07:20 PM] TenderstDM
"Good luck with the grave ill that troubles you", the man solemnly passes you the holy water.

[10-Jun-21 07:21 PM] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him)
Ta, any idea where I can get beeswax?

[10-Jun-21 07:23 PM] TenderstDM
Oh, he rummages around in his pack, "here you go lad, it's the least I can offer". He gives you the requisite wax free of charge.

[10-Jun-21 07:25 PM] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him)
Oh thank you so much! I toss him another gold

[10-Jun-21 07:29 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
"Good to see you found what you were looking for -- do you need me to make it still?"

[10-Jun-21 07:30 PM] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him)
If there's time, yes, if not, it can wait until we bed down on the road

[10-Jun-21 07:36 PM] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him)
I realise how that sounds now 😅

[10-Jun-21 07:36 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
"I think we have all day. *sniffs the beeswax* How long has this been sitting in that priest's cupboard?"

[10-Jun-21 07:37 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
"Don't flatter yourself 😉"

[10-Jun-21 08:16 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian goes looking for [[Magda]], [[Jeremiah]], [[Arlo]] and [[Ireena]].
"I have some information I need to share with you. There seems to be a serious threat to the Vistani people south of this camp. Their children have started to go missing, and like the elders said, they've sent a small hunting party to investigate this, but they have not returned. I've met one of the missing children's mother and she believes the culprits are night [[hags]]. She mentioned a windmill and a place called [[Berez]]. We need to help them!"

[10-Jun-21 08:20 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
To [[Ireena]] Varian says:
"I know you are in a rush to part to Vallaki and find [[Van Richten]], but these people need our help and there is so much information here we could get to help us in our mutual goal. Help me find these missing children and then maybe the Vistani people will help us even further."

To [[Magda]], [[Jeremiah]] and [[Arlo]] Varian says:
"I truly believe it will be in our best interests to help these children. Will you come with me? And if so, we should prepare ourselves for the worst."

[10-Jun-21 10:30 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
“I’m noticing a theme, Varian. A small child bats its eyes at you and your heart melts like an ice cream. 😒 However, you did save my life, and I’m not one to leave a debt unpaid. I’ll help you. [[Ireena]], please don’t leave without us — this shouldn’t take too long if we all put our steel to it.”

[11-Jun-21 08:14 AM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian flinches at that remark and glares at [[Magda]] for a split second.

“Surely you can see this goes beyond helping a child. It is to my understanding that they are already dead, so I would say it’s not so much about the children as it is about gaining the Vistani’s respect. There is so much more we need to learn from them. Have you even tried learning more about what [[Madame Eva]] told us?”

He looks at [[Jeremiah]] now, with a snigger.
“Isn’t knowledge your business? Gain their respect and I’m sure they would be happy to teach you more tricks.”

[11-Jun-21 09:11 AM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
"Varian, with all due respect, I came here for one reason and one reason only. To kill that monster from the church. The direct path to that, in my mind, lies with [[Van Richten]]. The respect of the Vistani would warm my heart but that would mean very little if that devil rips it out of my chest. I hope you understand that my willingness to divert from the path at all is not something I would even consider under normal circumstances. But I owe you a life debt, and I intend to make good."

"What are the deaths of a few night [[hags]]? There will always be more monsters, they multiply like cockroaches. But if we were to kill Him, I might make a difference."

😳 "Uh. *We*, might make a difference."

[12-Jun-21 10:06 AM] TenderstDM
[[Ireena]] steps forward, “Listen, I appreciate your desire to help - motivations aside. I am indeed eager to move on to Vallaki, but I have also sworn to protect those in need, and I honour this vow. Where I do take issue is with Night [[Hags]].”

“Varian, I believe you have misunderstood, if the [[witches of Berez]] were involved the whole camp would be in grave danger. They are known for attracting people to their cause, but rarely children. [[Hags]] are a different matter, but no less sinister. These are not people but monstrosities. A Night Hag may take human form to walk amongst us, but only to torment its prey. A single Hag, *maybe*, we could handle. If there is a full coven, then it would be a short rescue, and a painful eternity in which to regret it. This would be an evil beyond any of us.”

“How did you come to be certain that [[Hags]] are at work here?”

[12-Jun-21 12:35 PM] Varian Lo'Gosh (he/him)
Varian looks uncomfortable for a bit but tries to sound calm and not show emotions.

“I dreamt of this woman. In my dream, I was her child and she was embracing me. When I recognised her earlier I approached her and told her of it. She didn’t react well. She believes this means the night [[hags]] are back to the windmill on the road to Vallaki. She also believes I stole her child’s dream. I don’t understand how that could be, but I never intended it.”

[19-Jun-21 01:25 PM] TenderstDM
During your last night at the [[Vistani camp]] there is further commotion. Three of the hunting party have returned, but not as they left. They stare blankly at their old friends – the three seem only to be shells of the people they once were. Tied to one, a bag of pastries and a note: 
*Dreams are for the living my dears, so do make the most of yours. 
Bella, Ofelia & Mother Mog.*

By the early morning, the whole camp is astir. As [[Ireena]] makes preparations to leave, a now familiar elf approaches the group. [[Radu]] wishes to speak with you.

“I hear talk that you were planning on taking on the [[hags]]. Our camp elders have been foolish, they believed that old mill to be cursed, but we should have burnt it to the ground years ago. Now the [[hags]] are back, and all we can do is put up charms to ward them off.”

“I admit I wronged you – I do what I need to keep going out here, and in all honesty, I’d do it again. That said, you look to aid us now, at great risk to your own.” [[Radu]] presents, and returns, a small lock of [[Magda]]’s hair, “I’m afraid I no longer have the others”.

“If you do go, don’t think you can win in a straight fight. Sometimes you gotta fight dirty. If you can disrupt that mill – we still know it as the Old Bonegrinder – you might buy us time to put up our wards, and send warning to [[Barovia Town]] and Vallaki.”

He rummages around in his pocket, “take this too, break the glass and it has a good shot at holding back anyone – or any hag – nearby.” He hands you a thin chain with a glass bead, clear but with flashes of purple when it catches the light. “I’ve been saving it for a sticky situation.”

With that, he turns to leave.

[19-Jun-21 06:07 PM] [[Magdalena]] de Luna (she/her)
[[Magda]] looks at her hair as he leaves. “What did he do with the rest of my hair?” 😱

When no-one laughs; “It was a joke. Laugh now.”

[19-Jun-21 07:18 PM] [[Jeremiah]] Templeton (he/him)
[[Jeremiah]] laughs and calls after [[Radu]] saying "hey, if you want to know another trick, I'll trade you for Varian's hair!"

Once [[Radu]] is out of sight, I cast identify on the exploding necklace

[19-Jun-21 08:01 PM] TenderstDM
You find it is imbued with the hypnotic pattern spell, it has a DC15 save and will affect everyone in a 30ft cube, apart from the one who breaks it.
