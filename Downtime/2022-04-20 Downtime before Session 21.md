*The following is appended to that story in downtime chat.*

After [[Magda]] says she can't keep going with horses and chickens, [[Varian]] nods at her and says "We all have our trials to overcome. Hold on to what you believe in and you'll restore what is rightfully yours."

"I don't know what I believe anymore... I used to be so sure. Nowadays, it feels like everything's on the table. It'll all be so much easier once I've put a stake through that bastard's heart. It'll all be over..."

"I guess you're right. I can hold onto that. Thank you, friend."
