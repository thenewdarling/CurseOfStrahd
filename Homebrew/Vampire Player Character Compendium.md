# Vampire Player Character Compendium

*Most of a vampire’s victims become vampire spawn — ravenous creatures with a hunger for blood, mindless and under the control of the vampire that created them. Some do survive to become true vampires, who succeeds this transformation appears to come down to a strength of will.*  ***And my will is certainly strong.***

*A vampire must satiate their hunger for blood or suffer painful withdrawal. The blood itself seems to be something of a red herring, what a vampire truly needs is another sapient creature’s life force. For this reason, stored blood is ineffective, and the blood of beasts is never able to fully fulfil the vampire’s needs.*

### Vampire Traits
All vampires regardless of level add the following abilities and restrictions to their character sheet:

### Abilities
- *Darkvision* (60ft)
- Damage resistance to Necrotic
- *No Reflection*: Vampire player characters cast no reflection in mirrors, water, or other surfaces
- *Bite attack*: STR to hit (finesse), reach 5ft. The attacker has proficiency with this attack. The target is one humanoid who is either willing, grappled, incapacitated, or restrained. On a hit, target takes 1d6+3 piercing damage + 2d6 necrotic damage, and the attacker regains HP equal to damage dealt. If the target's HP are reduced to 0 by this attack, they die immediately.

### Restrictions

- Damage weakness to Radiant
- *Sunlight Sensitivity (vampire)*: While in direct sunlight, vampire PCs have disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks
- *Owned By The Night*: Vampire PCs have disadvantage on saving throws against the Charm ability of a greater vampire.
- *Stake to the Heart*: - If a vampire PC is incapacitated and a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into their heart, they are immediately destroyed.
- *Forbiddance*: A vampire PC must be invited into a home/residence by one of its occupants. If they do not, they take 5 radiant damage a round until they leave. (This radiant damage is unaffected by weaknesses and resistances.) The invitation must come from a resident of the building (eg. they cannot ask a party member to enter first and invite them in). As a result of this, buildings which are considered open to the public (such as taverns and places of business) do not trigger Forbiddance. (Written invitations count as invitations for the purposes of Forbiddance.)

### Born From Death

As vampires feed, they grow stronger, and as they fail to feed, they grow weaker. This is represented by the following stages:

**Stage 5: (unknown)**
**Stage 4 — (Consumed one sapient creature each week for a month)**
- Access to Shapechanger ability.
**Stage 3 — (Consumed one sapient creature in the last week)**
- Access to Children of the Night and Charm abilities.
**Stage 2 — (Partially fed on a sapient creature in the last week)**
- Access to Minor Regeneration ability.
**Stage 1 — (Consumed one beast in the last week)**
- Access to Spider Climb, Charm Person spells and the Misty Escape ability. 
- Must make DC15 WIS saving throw to resist uncontrollably attacking a bloodied creature within 15ft (exposed blood or significant weakness is enough to trigger vampiric urges). If previously higher, INT drops to 10 as the vampire struggles to keep hold of their rational mind.
**Stage 0 — (Failed to feed in over a week)**
- Weakened and in a fully frenzied state. If previously higher, INT drops to 4 and the creature behaves entirely animalistically.

**Note:**
- *Consumed* here means reduced to 0 HP with a Bite attack, instantly killing the drained creature and destroying the body.
- *Partially fed* here means reduced to 0 HP with a Bite attack, and optionally impose three levels of exhaustion on the drained creature instead of consuming them, as above.
- Any spells unlocked by *Born From Death* uses the save DC of their class. *Spider Climb* cast in this way has a range of Self.

### Unlocked Abilities

**Misty Escape**
A vampire PC at Stage 1 or higher can vanish in a puff of mist in response to harm. After you take damage, you can use your reaction to momentarily turn to a cloud of mist and teleport up to 30ft to an unoccupied space you can see. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

___

**Minor Regeneration**
A vampire PC who is at Stage 2 or higher and is conscious can use their bonus action to immediately consume a hit die and regain Hit Points, as they would during a short rest.

___

**Children of the Night**
A vampire PC who is at Stage 3 or higher has access to the *Find Familiar* spell.

___

**Charm**
A vampire PC who is at Stage 3 or higher can consume a second level spell slot or higher can attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you.

If the target can see you, the target must succeed on a DC17 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed. The charmed target regards you as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn’t under your control, it takes your requests or actions in the most favourable way it can, and it is a willing target for your bite attack.

Each time you or your companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours, or until you fall unconscious, or until you take a bonus action to end the effect.
