Combo moves are here to add some cooperative spice to combat. Each combo requires setup - moving into position, readying an action, etc. - then provides a bonus to damage, movement, or adds a flourishing effect.

## Eldritch Hammer
***Warlock & Melee Attacker***

**A Warlock’s Eldritch blast coincides with the melee weapon attack of an allied creature, causing a thunderous shockwave.**

- *Setup:* The player first in the initiative order must hold their action until the second player attacks - only the melee attacker needs to roll to hit.
- *Bonus:* The melee weapon is imbued with Eldritch energy, dealing its normal damage + the spell damage + an extra 1d10, and pushes the enemy back 10ft.
- *Risk:* If the melee attacker fails to hit, the Eldritch energy discharges from their weapon and both the attacker and their target take the spell damage.

## Bloodbath
***Fighter & Vampire***

**A Fighter attempts a difficult blow, gashing an opponent's neck so that a vampire may feed.**

- *Setup:* The Fighter must hit a creature susceptible to a vampire’s bite.
- *Bonus:* Until the Fighter’s next turn the creature gushes blood and a vampire may make a bite attack with advantage, without needing them to be otherwise restrained.
- *Risk:* The Fighter’s blow requires precision, effectively increasing the opponents AC by +1 during the attack.

## Leap of Faith
**Cleric, Druid, Paladin or Warlock**

***Worshipers of the divine open their minds to faiths beyond their own.***

-*Setup*: Two characters from the above classes must move and stay within 5ft of each other.
Using a bonus action, one of the characters can form, or later break, a spiritual bond with the other.
-*Bonus*: Whilst the two remain linked, both characters’ spell attack modifiers and spell save DCs increase by +1.
-*Risk*: If the characters move more than 5ft apart, or take damage, they must make a DC10 concentration saving throw. On a failed save, the bond is broken, the two characters are flung 10 ft apart, and any damage is split evenly between the two.

## Raining Men
**Artificer & Allied creature**

***A small Force Ballista cannon can propel an ally across the battlefield.***

-*Setup*: The allied creature must be at the cannon’s location, and not Large or greater in size.
The Artificer can ready the cannon to fire on their turn, or fire on the allied creature’s turn when they move into position.
-*Bonus*: The allied creature is propelled to anywhere within the cannon’s range.
If an enemy is targeted, the Artificer should roll to hit and deal damage – on a successful hit, the propelled creature may use their reaction to automatically make a melee hit as well.
-*Risk*: The propelled creature must make a DC12 Dex saving throw upon landing, or else fall prone, take 2D6 fall damage, and forfeit the automatic hit.
