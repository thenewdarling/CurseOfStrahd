**Alternate Rest Rules**

A short rest is counted when the players stop for 8 hours (including sleep), and a long rest is considered a 24 hour period that the players spend in a safe area (eg. a town) not engaging in combat.

A Long Rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 24 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, relaxed social encounters. The rest can persist after a single interruption - a period of strenuous activity. For example, less than 1 hour of travelling, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity.
