# Barovia Town

**Rurick**: the priest. Has a son, Elro.
**Ireena**: A knight we've befriended. (STRAHD'S FUCKING SISTER !!!! Known historically as Tatiana.)
**Ismarck**: Ireena's brother.
**Mary**: Has a missing daughter, Gertruda.
**Alenka and Mirabelle**: innkeepers, Blood on the Vine.
**Thorn**: Rose's brother, who passed away while she chose to stay on. 
**Callion** (deceased): Ireena's father. The burgomaster (mayor), who died shortly before the story began. He and Strahd had "disagreements" but not enough that Strahd didn't come to his funeral.

# The Vistani Camp

**Radu**: An elf bastard who steals hair. Probably sniffs it.
**Bildrith (presumably)**: The owner of Bildrith's Mercantile.
**Arturi**: ?
**Madame Eva**: the local wise woman. 

# Vallaki

#### Vallakoviches
**Baroness Lydia Vallakovich**: Widow of the Baron. The Vallakoviches and the Watcher families have long-standing tension. They do not stand for despair in the city, and quash any thoughts of leaving Barovia as they think there's no chance they'll ever escape.
**Viktor Vallakovich**: The son of the Baron.
**Alek**: One of Viktor's guards. There are two factions -- his watches the wall.

*Deceased*
**Baron Lito Vallakovich**: has a festival upcoming, the Festival of the Blazing Sun. Killed in the Battle of Burning Sun.

#### The Watchers (their Mark is a castle with an eye on it)

**Karl Watcher**: son of Lady Watcher. Hunter.
**Stella Watcher**: Daughter of Lady Watcher, was arranged to be married as a child with Viktor before the two families became enemies. Her mind has been switched with a cat, and her family think her insane now. The party have agreed to help them return her to her body.

*Deceased*
**Lady Fiona Watcher**: Head of an old noble family of Vallaki, they live in a manor off Old Svalich Road past the church. She has an information network across the entire city, and a grudge against the Vallakoviches. She organised the death of Izek, and paid the party to assassinate him. Killed by Magda at Strahd's behest, concluding the Battle of Burning Sun
**Nikolai Watcher**: son of Lady Watcher. Hunter. Killed in the Watcher Manor by the party minus Magda during the masquerade

#### Shops
**The Authors of Iron**: A blacksmith, inferior to:
**Prince Rupert**: a dragonborn who makes Lifehunter weapons and other magical weapons.
**Francis**: An apothecarist.
**Blinksy's**: a toy shop. Is no fun? Is no Blinksy!
**The Blue Water Inn** -- see Danika Martikov below.
**The Pale Horse Inn** -- another inn that the Watchers put Henrick up in.

#### Historical

**Saint Andreal of the Morning Lord**: Brought the religion of the Morning Lord to Barovia. Her remains were buried locally and were disturbed by a plot by the Watchers, but were recovered by the party and returned to the church.

#### Other notable figures

**Dargos Weerdo**: Knows about armour and also the history of escaping Barovia. Raised two children, Myrtle and Freek, with his husband. We met the family saving the children from the hags.
**Danika Martikov**: innkeeper of the Blue Water Inn. Has two sons, Brom and Bray, 12 and 14 respectively.
**Father Lucian**: runs the church. Knows more about Barovia's history than most. Spritely for a 90 year-old.

*Deceased*
**Jacob Weerdo** -- husband of Dargos, now turned to spawn and killed in the Battle of Burning Sun
Urwin Martikov -- husband of Danika Martikov, killed in the Battle of Burning Sun. Urwin has a cousin with a vineyard but the wine has stopped coming. 
Izek: the town captain. Has some kind of vendetta for Varian based on a prophecy by Madame Eva. Known as Dranos as a child. Murdered by Varian.
Henrick van der Voort: an elderly mortician who runs the morgue and cuts gravestones. Lady Watcher paid him to keep bodies in his attic rather than sending them to burial -- they started to move and he freaked out and tried to back out, at which point she blackmailed him. He also hid the remains of Saint Andreal outside the city. Hanged by the Baron after the party shortsightedly convinced him to hand himself in.  

# Krezk

**Yalom, the Abbot of St Markovia**: the leader of the most powerful church in Barovia it seems. He is disillusioned and in Strahd's pocket but managed to hold back Jeremiah's zombification for a price.
**Sergei**: the ghost of Strahd's mentor, best friend, and brother-in-law. Forced to live out eternity in a small room with Yalom.
**̶A̶r̶a̶b̶e̶l̶l̶e̶:**̶ ̶a̶ ̶y̶o̶u̶n̶g̶ ̶w̶o̶m̶a̶n̶ ̶w̶h̶o̶ ̶r̶u̶n̶s̶ ̶a̶ ̶f̶a̶r̶m̶ ̶j̶u̶s̶t̶ ̶o̶u̶t̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶K̶r̶e̶s̶k̶,̶ ̶o̶r̶ ̶o̶w̶n̶s̶ ̶h̶o̶r̶s̶e̶s̶ ̶a̶t̶ ̶l̶e̶a̶s̶t̶.̶ ̶S̶h̶e̶ ̶i̶s̶ ̶p̶e̶r̶c̶e̶p̶t̶i̶v̶e̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶c̶l̶e̶v̶e̶r̶,̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶a̶ ̶g̶o̶o̶d̶ ̶s̶h̶o̶t̶.̶ ̶S̶h̶e̶ ̶o̶f̶f̶e̶r̶e̶d̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶p̶a̶r̶t̶y̶ ̶a̶n̶o̶t̶h̶e̶r̶ ̶t̶a̶r̶o̶t̶ ̶r̶e̶a̶d̶i̶n̶g̶,̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶h̶e̶r̶ ̶c̶a̶r̶d̶s̶ ̶b̶u̶r̶s̶t̶ ̶i̶n̶t̶o̶ ̶f̶l̶a̶m̶e̶s̶ ̶u̶n̶d̶e̶r̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶P̶O̶W̶E̶R̶ ̶O̶F̶ ̶D̶E̶S̶T̶I̶N̶Y̶.̶ [#TAASNEAK]
**Markug**: runs the food court. A trustworthy person, but Magda used Charm on him so he probably hates us now.
**Areti**: Markug's sister, who works with the local watch.
**Karloman**: a monk who failed the trial of initiation into the Abbey. Despite failing the trial, the light of the Morning Lord took his sight (as it does with all who attempt).
**Rerakir**: a stable hand, he's looking after our horses.
**Luca and Shaun**: Elvish merchants who the party saved on their way to Vallaki. They're currently staying there now while they get their affairs in order 

# Argynvosthold

An area south of Vallaki, Jeremiah found a coin from there. Inscribed "The light that watches over the darkness." 

# The Winery

**The Keepers of the Feather**: Adrianna, Benjy, Davian, Elver, and the Martikovs. Shapeshifting followers of Mother Night. Adrianna, Benjy, Davian and Elver. Adrianna is a werewolf, and the others transform into ravens. Davian is Urwin's older brother, and Benjy and Elver are partners, with Elver expecting a child. 

# Berez
**The Witches of Berez**: apparently cruel and horrible, but the aesthetic will surely be on fire. Double, double, toil and trouble indeed. They promise a way out -- whether physically escaping Barovia, or a more metaphorical escape, no one is sure. 

# Yester Hill
**Eliza Day** *(deceased)*: Murdered by Nicholas, her spirit in the rose garden kept the winery flowing with grapes despite the lack of sunlight.
**Nicholas** *(deceased)*: buried under the tree of Yester Hill after allegedly murdering Eliza Day and stealing a piece of the sun sword. Something broke out of the tree and trapped him between life and death, before he was killed for good by Magda. 

# Other Locations

**Dr. Rudolph van Richten**: a famous vampire hunter. We met him as Danton: a "Great Performer from Krezk", who was staying in Vallaki at the Blue Water Inn. He has great standing with the people and is generally seen as a celebrity.
**Sasha**: Has history with Ireena and Strahd both. Used to be Strahd's partner. Also has a holy symbol of Asmodeus, similar to Magda's.
**Iggwilv, also known as Tasha the Dark**: a wizard who led a revolt trying to leave Barovia. She failed, and Vallaki has been staunchly anti-escape since.
**Ezmerelda d'Avenir**: We heard about her as 'the Vistani Wanderer', and then much later ran into her on the road to Krezk. She revealed Danton's true identity, but we prioritised Jeremiah's zombie problem over going with her to the Tower to meet Danton and Tasha.
**The three hags** *(all now deceased)*:
	- Mog, the pie seller
	- Bella
	- Ofelia, who stole Rose's soul and trapped her in a hellhound.
