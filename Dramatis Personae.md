#### [[Vallakoviches]]

**Alek**: One of Viktor's guards. There are two factions -- his watches the wall.

*Deceased*

#### The [[Watchers]]

**Karl Watcher**: son of Lady Watcher. Hunter.

**Yalom, the Abbot of St Markovia**: the leader of the most powerful church in Barovia it seems. He is disillusioned and in Strahd's pocket but managed to hold back Jeremiah's zombification for a price.
**Sergei**: the ghost of Strahd's mentor, best friend, and brother-in-law. Forced to live out eternity in a small room with Yalom.

**Markug**: runs the food court. A trustworthy person, but Magda used Charm on him so he probably hates us now.
**Areti**: Markug's sister, who works with the local watch.
**Karloman**: a monk who failed the trial of initiation into the Abbey. Despite failing the trial, the light of the Morning Lord took his sight (as it does with all who attempt).
**Rerakir**: a stable hand, he's looking after our horses.
