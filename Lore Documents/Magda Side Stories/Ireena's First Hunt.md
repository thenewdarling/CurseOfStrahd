*The following takes place on the morning of Day 32, the morning after the party arrive back at [[The Winery]] in [[Strahd Session 40]].*

It was cold as the first morning light started to poke through the mists, and the air was wet with the aftermath of rain.

Magda stood over Ireena, who had slept in the barn. She kicked her with one foot. “Wake up.”

Ireena snorted, and sat up, wiping tear tracks that were already dry from her face. “What time is it?”

“Breakfast time,” Magda said, stony-faced. She turned. “Come on. We have work to do.”

__

“Why are we doing this?” Ireena said. Her whole body ached. She could feel the curse sinking deeper and deeper into her bones, soaking into the pores in her marrow. It made her want to claw her skin off.

“Because the alternative is eating people,” Magda said. “You will want to do it. On the worst days, you will convince yourself you’re _right_ to do it. That’s the scariest bit.” She took a humble knife from her corset and passed it to her. “And so, we kill animals.”

“I already know how to hunt,” Ireena took the blade, held it in her hand.

“You hunt as a human, it’s different,” Magda said. She tapped her nose, and said, “What do you smell?”

Ireena sniffed the air. “Wet… Mud. Wow, it really came down last night.” 

Magda turned her gently forty degrees. “What now?”

Ireena sniffed again. “A deer.”

“A human would need a bow to hit it.”

“How far away is it?”

“I think… just on the other side of that thicket.” Her eyes narrowed on the bush, like a rifle’s aim. “Go.”

“No.”

“This is your life now, Ireena. You can sit around feeling sorry for yourself, or you can kill Bambi instead.”

“No, I—” Ireena swallowed. “I don’t want to feed it. The curse.”

Magda nodded, sucking her tongue. “I see. Well, there is one other option.” She took the knife back, and offered the stake in the holster under her arm. “Go on, then.”

Ireena recoiled from the stake. Some inner, primal urge like the instinct to step back from fire.

Magda smiled. “I thought so.”

“You don’t understand,” Ireena said. “You don’t get it.”

“You said the same thing to Arabelle last night,” Magda said. “Ireena, I am the _only_ one who understands. I stood where you are standing, two hundred and fifty years ago.”

“I don’t know who I am,” Ireena said. “I don’t know who I was… I… I can’t even control my own actions now, I can’t trust my own brain.”

“You can,” Magda said. “That panic you’re feeling? That fear, that dread? That’s also your brain. If you had no choice, there would be no point worrying about it.”

Ireena tensed, digesting. “I don’t… want to be this.”

“It is what we are,” Magda said. “You can go get platitudes from the others, but if you want to live this is your life now.”

“I’m not what he says I am,” Ireena said. “He doesn’t get to choose my life.”

“You’re right. He doesn’t. And I mean for us to put him in the ground where he belonged centuries ago.” She put the stake away, and offered the knife again. “But we are vampires. Creatures of the night. And you will need to make a choice. Are you Ireena Kolyana, a monster who lives well? Or Tatiana von Zarovich, a monster of other’s making?”

Ireena took the knife. It felt so crude compared to her longsword, like a whetted stone in her hands.

In one fluid motion, she threw it into the brush. There was a gargled, strangulating noise, and a muffled thump as something hit the ground. “I am Ireena, of Barovia Town. Paladin of the Morning Lord. And the devil does not own me.”

Magda smiled like a Cheshire cat. “Fantastic.”

Ireena moved to enter the brush and retrieve her kill, when Magda stopped her. “You... already killed it,” she said sheepishly. “The blood is just liquid after death, you’d be drinking it for no reason.”

Ireena sighed. “Let me get the knife back at least.”

“That was a good moment though, I liked it,” Magda smiled to herself while Ireena dug around in the deer’s corpse. She turned north, away from the camp. “I think there’s another one nearby.”

“Well,” Ireena wiped the blood off the knife on the grass soaked with dew, before standing up to her full height. “Let’s go be monsters.”
