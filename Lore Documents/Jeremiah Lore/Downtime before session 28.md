[[Jeremiah]] talks to the Father of the [[abbot]] and how little he can give. [[Father Lucian]] bows his head in sadness, though in doing noticing the bow on the goblin's back. He asked [[Jeremiah]] if he had been learning to shoot the bow as part of his magical studies, but it was now the goblin's turn to bow his head. "My mind has grown slow with sickness, it takes me learning this to continue helping my friends". [[Father Lucian]]'s keen eyes looked back with recognition. "I lost my chance to frie a bow many years ago, and turned to more academic pursuits instead." He revealed a g hand to [[Jeremiah]], that had previously always been carrying a book, bell, or candle, and [[Jeremiah]] saw that the fingers would not move from their curled state." Have you never found a way to heal yourself? " [[Jeremiah]] asked." No, it seems it is a part of me that no magic can fix". "And... H-how long has it... Lasted?" Tears welling in the goblin's eyes. "Must be sixty years now I think". [[Father Lucian]] returned his book to his clawed hand but when he looked back up [[Jeremiah]] was gone. 


[[Jeremiah]] ran through the town unconsciously weaving the charm of invisibility. The guards heard a faint sobbing sound but thought it was a spirit finally leaving [[Vallaki]].
