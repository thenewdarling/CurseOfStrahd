*The following takes place during [[Session 39]], when [[Baba Lysaga]] kills [[Arabelle]].*

___

The roots of the Creeping Hut have entangled your limbs.

*“Wake up!”* Somewhere in the distance, Bromley is shouting at the top of his lungs. *“Wake! Up!”*

But it is dark. And you are cold. And the roots are grasping tighter around your corpse. Silly Bromley. The dead can’t wake up.

You didn’t know what death would feel like, little Arabelle of Krezk. You didn’t know how it would feel so cold, so cold and yet you cannot shiver.

*“Wake up!”*

You can see it now. The river of the dead that flows through Barovia. Your friends, your ancestors, trapped here so tightly that even the reaper cannot claim them. The shards of souls you stole from the witch’s hut are joining them. Those who can, scream. For many, there is not enough of them left to understand what is happening to them.

Bromley is with them. Floating listlessly past, carried by the tide. You try to shout out to him, but you are dead. You cannot move. You cannot breathe. You try to scream but you have no mouth.

He sees you, as he’s swept out into the river of death. He calls to you. *“Wake up!”*

But you are so tired. Why doesn’t he understand?

*“Run, Arabelle! Run!”*

The two of you are running through your parents’ field as children, running until your little lungs give in and you collapse in peals of laughter, sending the pollen scattering in puffy clouds around you.

You are chasing him through a hole in Farmer Barkley’s store, carrying an incriminating ear of corn. Later you will grill your spoils over a fire, and share it as the sun goes down.

You are watching him disappear over the hill, leaving you for the Witches, and it is only once he is gone you realise you’ve made a mistake. You run, you chase him, for hours it feels like, well into the night, but he is already gone.

“I was too late.” You do not say your shame out loud, because you no longer have a tongue. The Creeping Hut squeezes your body but you no longer feel pain. Arlo is running to your side, pouring a health potion in your mouth that doesn’t taste of anything. Baba Lysaga has her hands full with your friends, but for a moment, she seems to look up. Look directly in your eyes. A smile cracks her decrepit lips, like old parchment.

*“Run!”* 

Bromley is still shouting but you can no longer see him. No longer make him out over the millions of others. The cacophony of their misery. Their flailing, grasping limbs. 

You can see all Barovia now, like a bird overhead, rising on an air current. How small this nation is. No wonder the devil claws at its edges, desperate to be free. Like a liquid, you are everywhere. Like a gas, you are nowhere. And you too are being pulled into the currents.

Magda is swiping at Arlo, shoving him out of the way, only to hover over your corpse like she’s afraid of breaking you. They are shouting at each other, but you can no longer hear the words. Silly Magda. You are already broken, a shattered vase on the ground. No healing magic will reach you here.

And then something grabs you. A dark hand reaches around your spirit and pulls you into mooring, like a boat in dock. You are so tired, so tired…

A drow man looks you over, ponders you. His red eyes crease with sadness. “You. What are you doing here?” You do not know much about this man, you can barely remember him. But you remember, he hated seeing children suffering. 

He holds you, like a candle, on the side of the mountain outcropping. An icy wind blows around you, the flurry of snow capping his hair. 

An enormous spider perches on his back like a throne. Its bulbous abdomen quivering, its legs twitching, stroking his neck, clutching his torso.

Bromley shouts.

*“Run, Arabelle!”*

The spider clicks its mandibles angrily.

*You* are running. *Arlo has a spider on his shoulder, tiny compared to this monstrosity. Danika has opened a portal, she flies ahead in raven form. The witches are laughing, and then you are blind.*

A vision. But… you have no future left to tell.

The dark elf smiles at you, and despite his wickedness it is a warm smile. For that moment he shared your power, shared the vision. “It seems you’re not finished yet. Good luck.” The spider clicks at him impatiently, and he blows you back onto the breeze.

*“You have to run!”* Bromley’s voice is hoarse, exhausted. *“Wake up, Arabelle!”*

Bromley’s spirit is before you, he reaches out his hand.

You are children again, and he is pulling you up from a ledge.

He is hanging from the gallows, eyes bulging and manic as he tries to tell you something.

Flames lick at your spirit, a different kind of magic.

*“Wake up!”* Bromley shouts, but now he sounds like Magda.

You scramble away from the voice, desperate to reach Bromley, as he’s being pulled, yet again out of your reach. Always out of reach. You are watching him disappear into the distance in Krezk. You are watching him disappear as the Witches drop you into Old Berez.

“Sorry to interrupt,” says a smooth, silky voice. A suave, dark man with a suit of green crocodile and curled horns of red ivory. He takes your outstretched hand, as though you’d been extending it for a dance. He pulls you away, plucks you like a tangerine from a fruit bowl. He holds you like a waltz partner. “You’re needed back home.”

You still have no mouth to speak.

He spins you around as though in a ballroom, ducking and laughing as the other spirits grasp at him for clemency. “You know, Barovia is hard enough to reach, but Berez? And… whatever is going on on top of it? She does like to make it difficult for me.”

The world is spinning so fast now. You are starting to feel sick. Dizzy. You don’t know where you are. You can’t keep track of what you’re seeing. You’re trying to spot Bromley, if you can just find him… 

He’s shouting in your head. *“Run! Keep running!”* But you’ve been running so long. He’s always been too far away. 

*“You can get me later but now you have to run!”*

Wait, what is he talking about?

*“Run, Arabelle! As fast as your legs will carry you! Nothing will be left of Berez!”*

Of Berez?

The Lord of Hell kisses you on the cheek. “Give that to my girl for me, please?” He spins you like a top, like a highland dance and everything is blurring together. Your spirit is alight with hell flame and it licks at your heels until it’s all you can see, everything is red--

A whisper in your ear. Your real ear, this time. Dark curls of hair tickling your face.

“Don’t think you’re getting off that easy. The ground isn’t ready for you yet,” Magda hisses through tears.

There is a cloud of diamond dust over your body, catching the fragments of your soul as they try to escape like smoke. The river is fading once again into the Barovian mists. The voices of the damned begin to fade, and then there is darkness.

Darkness.

Darkness.

And then the light floods in. You gasp as your lungs inflate, your heart punches in your ribcage. Your eyes snap open, you grab Magda and Arlo instinctively like a life-raft and a vision rocks you to your core. One you have seen some of before.

*There is no warning, not a whisper of wind, or murmur of thunder, as the rain fills the river. The dam is breaking, and the few who scream are too little and too late.* 

*Vacant eyes hang from the gallows, showing neither pleasure nor sorrow, as those who had wronged them are swept from the world. They look to you now.* 

*Bromley looks to you now.* 

*And across the boundaries between this world and the next, he begs you to run.*
