*It is dark and the wind howls anguished outside. The flame of her candle crackles softly, casting long shadows across the room, enhancing the terrors already so real in her mind. The book in her hands is heavy. With secrets. With knowledge. With magic.*
*She knows she must do it, and she is curious even, of what she might learn about Strahd. This tome, his journal, will bind her to him, hold her still as the rest of her home disappears into the void. But it may also hide some knowledge they could use to defeat himâ€¦ Arabelle opens the Tome of Strahd and reads the first line:*
*"Tomorrow, I conquer this valley."*
-- [[Arabelle]], reading [[Strahd's diary]] on the downtime after Day 31

**Strahdlamity** is the out-of-character term for the actions of the [[Dark Powers]] to imprison [[Strahd]] von Zarovich for all eternity, banishing the Valley of [[Barovia]] into a misty demiplane.

It also refers to the mini-campaign of the same name; a series of extended flashbacks together known as the "Tome of Strahd". Almost all of the character options are people instrumental in Barovian history. Characters begin at level 12.

Strahdlamity starts in the summer of 2023, dungeon mastered by [[Taanit]].
