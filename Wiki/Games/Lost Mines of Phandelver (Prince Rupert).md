The Lost Mines of Phandelver is a starter campaign and setting for DnD 5e which has been run many times throughout the group in different configurations.

[[Taanit]] ran a session of it on Saturday 20th August 2022 starring [[Prince Rupert]], showing his youthful days of adventuring in his twenties before being trapped in [[Barovia]].

Who knows when we will see the rest of his adventure...?
