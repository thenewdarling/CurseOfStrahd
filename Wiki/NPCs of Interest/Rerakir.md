**Rerakir** is a stable hand in [[Krezk]], who looked after the party's horses and tasked them with returning the scales at the bottom of a pool that turned out to be full of holy water.

After they had to leave sharply, they likely still carry the key he gave them to complete this task and half the money he gave them for the job in advance.
