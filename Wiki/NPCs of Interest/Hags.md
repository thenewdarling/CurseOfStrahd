*Dreams are for the living my dears, so do make the most of yours.
[[Bella]], [[Ofelia]] & Mother [[Mog]].
-- a message left by the Hags


The three Hags -- **Mog**, **Bella** and **Ofelia** -- were the first major antagonists of the [[Curse of Strahd campaign]]. They lived in the Old [[Bonegrinder]] Mill.

The party failed to kill any of them when they first fought them in Session 4, and in retaliation [[Ofelia]] trapped [[Rose]]'s soul in a hellhound. Once the party reached [[Vallaki]] they were unable to breach its walls to get revenge directly. 

When the party left [[Vallaki]] for [[Krezk]], they were ambushed by the hags once more, culminating in a battle in Session 15, in which all three of them were killed.

#### Other Details
- The party retrieved a number of potions from their possessions, including a bottle of [[Potion of Cackle Fever]] which was confiscated by [[Francis]] when he identified it.
