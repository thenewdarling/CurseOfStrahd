**Gertruda** is a character the party heard about in [[Barovia Town]] in [[Session 1]]. 

She was missing, and her mother [[Mary]] speculated that she went looking for the [[Witches of Berez]].

The party finally meet her in [[Session 34]]. She would rather not speak about her mother, saying only of her that 'she was lost, they all were'.
