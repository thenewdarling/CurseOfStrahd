**[[Yalom]]**, also known as the **Abbot of St. Markovia** or the **Abbot of [[Krezk]]**, is the leader of the most powerful church in [[Barovia]].

After meeting him in Session 18, the party learn that he is disillusioned and in [[Strahd]]'s pocket. He manages to hold back [[Jeremiah]]'s zombification, for a price, and gives them information on where to find the hilt of the [[Sun Sword]].

When the party arrive at [[Castle Ravenloft]] in Session 28, they discover he has been petrified by [[Strahd]] for his disobedience in disposing of the [[Sun Sword]], and stands in his courtyard as a living statue, with outstretched angel wings.
