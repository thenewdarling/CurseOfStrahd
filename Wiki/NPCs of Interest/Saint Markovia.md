A historical figure in [[Barovia]] history, **Saint Markovia** apparently arrived before [[Strahd]] did, fighting and defeating a dragon, [[Kala]], in what is now [[Krezk]].

The grounds of this victory became the [[Abbey]] in the center of [[Krezk]], and the scales in its fountains seem to be reminiscent of that victory, if not direct spoils.
