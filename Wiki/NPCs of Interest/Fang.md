**Fang** is a tiefling bandit who lives near [[Lake Zarovich]]. He was sent by [[Aleksandr]] to retrieve [[Magda]], finally meeting the [[Heroes of Burning Sun]] in [[Berez]].

The party had previously heard of bandits near [[Lake Zarovich]] looking for them, while back in [[Vallaki]].

For deserting [[Flynn]] in the forest, he and [[Naesela]] were transformed into vile bat creatures and banished to [[Old Berez]], where the party were told to kill them. They were instead incapacitated, and [[Arabelle]] removed the transformation with *Remove Curse*.
