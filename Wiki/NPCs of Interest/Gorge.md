**Goric**, known to the party mostly as **Gorge** (as in 'gorgeous'), but also as **Gorg** and **Curious Gorge**, is a goblin that the party took prisoner in the [[Lost Mines of Phandelver (Prince Rupert)]] campaign first session. 

The party carried him in a backpack and bribed him with meat to give them information and carry a lantern. 

His main character trait was thinking he was a genius strategist going along with the party and deciding to side with 'the victor', but he wasn't very good at hiding this fact.

He had a notable toothy grin when he thought he was getting away with something.

As an NPC, he was played by Taanit.
