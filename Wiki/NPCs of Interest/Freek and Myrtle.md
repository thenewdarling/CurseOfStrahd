**Freek and Myrtle Weerdo** are two very cute children that the party saved from the [[Hags]].

Their fathers are [[Jakob]] and [[Dargos]] Weerdo.

For the [[Battle of Burning Sun]] they were spirited away to [[The Winery]] by [[Danika]] for their own safety, along with her own children.

[[Dargos]], who remained in [[Vallaki]] for the fighting and was their only surviving father, was collected by [[Danika]] after [[Session 27]] to reunite them.

#### Other Details
- They have literally never been seen apart from each other so they get one wiki entry.
