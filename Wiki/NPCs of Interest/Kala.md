**Kala the Fallen One** was a dragon, presumably silver, and the brother of [[Argynvost]]. He was killed by [[Saint Markovia]] in what is now [[Krezk]]. 

His scales were used in the construction of a fountain in the [[Abbey]], and the final resting place of his skeleton is alongside his brother in the Tomb of [[Argynvost]] in [[Argynvostholt]].

The party encountered his remains in [[Session 33]], when [[Arabelle]], [[Ireena]] and [[Neander]] were tasked with taking his skull to swap with the [[Skull of Argynvost]] as a decoy to placate [[Strahd]].
