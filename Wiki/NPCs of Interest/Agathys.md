**Agathys** was [[Arabelle]]'s mother, who shared her gift of foresight.

She died before the beginning of the campaign, along with [[Arabelle]]'s father [[Miodrag]]. She was mentioned by name in the lore document *Witches' Reach*, in which [[Hilda]] speaks to how she was extremely well-respected in [[Vallaki]]'s Lower Gallows.
