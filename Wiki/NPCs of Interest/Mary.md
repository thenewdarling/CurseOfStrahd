*"A mind is a terrible thing to lose, as is a daughter..."* -- Mary


**'Mad' Mary** was a woman living in [[Barovia Town]] that the party met briefly in [[Session 1]]. Following her death, she became a major confidant in [[Varian]]'s dreams using his Phantom Rogue features.

She had a missing daughter, [[Gertruda]], who she suspected left to find the [[Witches of Berez]].

Some of her conversations with [[Varian]] are documented in the lore document *Mad Mary*.
