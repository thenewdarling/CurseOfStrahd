**Pidlwick II** is a small creature that lives within [[Wiki/Places of Interest/Castle Ravenloft]]. They stand watch over the halls at night, and sound the alarm when [[Arabelle]] goes exploring at night in [[Session 30]].

It is unclear whether Pidlwick is a living creature or some kind of automaton or construct.
