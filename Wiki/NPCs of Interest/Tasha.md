**Iggwilv**, also known as **Tasha the Dark** is a female wizard who led a revolt trying to leave [[Barovia]]. She failed, and [[Vallaki]] has been staunchly anti-escape since.

Her tower lies between [[Vallaki]] and [[The Winery]], but the party was waylaid when destiny drew them there -- they arrived later to find it empty.
