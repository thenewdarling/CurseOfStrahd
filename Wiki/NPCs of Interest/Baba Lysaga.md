The party first heard about her in [[Session 34]], when arriving in town. She lives in a hut that walks on chicken legs, and submerges into the lake.

Her daughter [[Minerva]] was murdered in a witch hunt, and she retaliated by culling the town of [[Old Berez]], creating the false paradise of the new town. She, however, never leaves [[Old Berez]].
