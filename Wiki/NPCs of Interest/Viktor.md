**Viktor Vallakovich** is the [[Baron]] and [[Baroness]]'s son, and following the [[Battle of Burning Sun]], he is the patriarch of the [[Vallakoviches]]. He lived a sheltered life, and had a star-crossed love with the youngest of the [[Watchers]], [[Stella]].

He is a student of magic, and accidentally spliced her mind with a cat. It was put right by the party, and his life was saved by their actions.

He and [[Stella]] currently run [[Vallaki]] technically following the [[Battle of Burning Sun]], though they are trying to establish democracy. By [[Strahd Session 27]], they are trying to rebuild the destroyed Vallakovich Manor as a town hall.
