*"They no longer know themselves. They know not friend from foe." - [[Godfrey Gwilyn]]*

The **Silver Knights** were sworn defenders of [[Argynvost]], that stood against [[Strahd]] after he and the rest of [[Barovia]] were trapped in the mists.

[[Strahd]] defeated them, leaving them husks of their former selves, wandering the halls of their home, slowly losing their memories over time. [[Godfrey Gwilyn]] explained that since no souls in [[Barovia]] can move on, [[Vladimir Horngaard]]'s rage, hatred and malice binds them to the place of their death.
