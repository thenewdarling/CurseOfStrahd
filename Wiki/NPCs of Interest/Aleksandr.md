**Aleksandr** was the top lieutenant in [[Magda]]'s army, a confidante and her second in command. 

Some two hundred and fifty years ago before the events of the [[Curse of Strahd campaign]], he was the last person to leave in the evacuation of [[Iliadvar]], as [[Magda]] wanted to 'go down with the ship' -- depicted in lore document *The Death of Castle Eclipsis*.

In [[Session 35]], it was revealed that shortly after escaping, he was spirited into [[Barovia]], and he has lived his life there into a very old age. 

He sent his son, [[Flynn]], to find her, but he died in battle with [[Rahadin]] aiding the party's escape.
