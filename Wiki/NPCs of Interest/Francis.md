An apothecarist in [[Vallaki]], across the road from [[Blinksy]]'s shop.

He confiscates a vial of cackle fever that the party took from the [[hags]]. After the [[Battle of Burning Sun]], looters smash it, and they manage to counteract the effects, but [[Magda]] and [[Varian]] suffer exhaustion for days while it passes out of their system.

By Session 27, his shop is still under quarantine to prevent the spread of cackle fever, so he is working out of [[Blinksy]]'s shop across the road. The sign over Blinksy's now reads "IS NO FUN FRANCIS".
