An apothecarist in [[Vallaki]], across the road from [[Blinksy]]'s shop.

He confiscates a vial of cackle fever that the party took from the [[hags]]. After the [[Battle of Burning Sun]], looters smash it, and they manage to counteract the effects, but [[Magda]] and [[Varian]] suffer exhaustion for days while it passes out of their system.
