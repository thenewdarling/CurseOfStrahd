*SPOILERS BELOW!*

**Dr. Rudolph van Richten** is a famous vampire hunter, also known publically through his underground alias [[Danton]].

The party initially meet him in this guise, as a "Great Performer from [[Krezk]]", who was staying in [[Vallaki]] at the [[Blue Water Inn]]. He has great standing with the people and is generally seen as a celebrity. The party become friends and allies with him, and he helps to organise the defense in the [[Battle of Burning Sun]].

After finding out his true identity, the party plan to meet him at [[Tasha]]'s Tower, but are waylaid by [[Jeremiah]]'s worsening condition and decide to go to [[Krezk]] instead. Following this, the Tower is attacked by [[Rahadin]]. [[Van Richten]] escapes while [[Ezmerelda]] is captured, and the party are unable to find him again until [[Session 31]], when they are spirited to [[Argynvostholt]] by [[Ireena]]. He appears to have aged fifty years by the experience of fighting Rahadin.
