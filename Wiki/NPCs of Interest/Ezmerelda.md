**Ezmerelda d'Avenir**, also known as the **Vistani Wanderer** is a figure of fame within [[Barovia]].

The party hear about her very quickly after arriving in [[Barovia]], and she is mentioned in the original reading given by [[Madame Eva]]. Much later, they run into her on the road to [[Krezk]]. She revealed [[Danton]]'s true identity, but the party prioritised [[Jeremiah]]'s zombie problem over going with her to the Tower to meet [[Danton]] and [[Tasha]].
