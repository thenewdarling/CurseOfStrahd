Henrick van der Voort

An elderly mortician who runs the morgue and cuts gravestones. [[Lady Watcher]] paid him to keep bodies in his attic rather than sending them to burial -- they started to move and he freaked out and tried to back out, at which point she blackmailed him. He also hid the remains of [[Saint Andreal ]] outside the city. Hanged by the [[Baron]] after the party shortsightedly convinced him to hand himself in.
