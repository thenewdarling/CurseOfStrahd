**Henrick van der Voort** was an elderly mortician who ran the morgue and cut gravestones.

[[Lady Watcher]] paid him to keep bodies in his attic rather than sending them to burial. Whey started to move, he tried to back out, at which point she blackmailed him into hiding the remains of [[Saint Andreal]] outside the city.

For this, he was hanged by the [[Baron]] after the party shortsightedly convinced him to hand himself in.
