**Nicholas** was a human man buried under the tree of [[Yester Hill]] for allegedly murdering [[Eliza Day]] and stealing a piece of the [[Sun Sword]]. 

Something broke out of the tree and trapped him between life and death, before he was seemingly killed for good by [[Magda]]'s Turn Undead ability.

After leaving the [[Heroes of Burning Sun]], [[Varian]] travelled through the [[Underdark]] of [[Barovia]] in lore document *Darkly I Gaze Into The Days Ahead*, where he encountered Nicholas once more, now in a more feral form, before pushing him into a river of lost souls.
