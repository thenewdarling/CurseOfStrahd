**Hilda** is an elderly human witch who lives in [[Vallaki]]'s Lower Gallows, as part of the Vallaki Coven. She owns the [[Wicker's Hut]].

She first appeared in the lore document *Title to be confirmed*, where she helped [[Arabelle]] and [[Alek]] deal with [[Mordesh]].

#### Background

Disinterested in Vallaki politics, Hilda hadn't ventured out of the Lower Gallows for years. It seems she has only now seen its current state, and has decided not to hide away anymore -- appearing as she did later in Session 28.

She knew [[Arabelle]]'s mother well.

#### Other Notes
- She taught Arabelle how to cast both *Remove Curse* and *Locate Creature*.
