**Sergei** is the ghost of [[Strahd]]'s mentor, best friend, and brother-in-law. He was forced to live out eternity in a small room with [[Yalom]].

In his appearance in lore document *Lord of the Land* he was shown to inherit the title of the [[Abbot]] of [[Saint Markovia]], and the clergy allowed him to take the [[Holy Symbol of Ravenkind]]

There is almost definitely a lot more to put here...
