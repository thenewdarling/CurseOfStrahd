**Eden** is [[Magda]]'s familiar, cast through the *Find Familiar* spell. His usual form is a large white and yellow snake, and he is a servant of [[Asmodeus]].

His relationship with [[Magda]] seems to be contractual in nature but long-standing before the events of the campaign. She speaks to him as if an old friend when he first appears on-screen in the lore document *Here, in the Garden*.

#### Other Details

- Eden appears to dislike taking other forms, such as when [[Magda]] changed him into an owl in [[Krezk]] in [[Strahd Session 16]].
- [[Magda]] doesn't seem to have the ability to summon him in [[Barovia]] without feeding her vampire powers a certain amount. (Mechanically, she must feed on a sentient being in the last week to gain access to Find Familiar.)
