**Lady [[Fiona]] Watcher** was the matriarch of an old noble family of [[Vallaki]]. She ran [[Watcher Manor]].

She had an information network across the entire city, and a grudge against the [[Vallakoviches]]. She organised the death of [[Izek]] and the theft of the Bones of [[Saint Andreal]], while building an army of vampire spawn under the city's noses.

At [[Strahd]]'s behest, she was murdered by [[Magda]], concluding the [[Battle of Burning Sun]].
