**Mordesh** is a half-elven woman in Vallaki believed to be inciting civil war following the [[Battle of Burning Sun]].

She was first seen in the downtime between session 27 and 28, in one of [[Arabelle]]'s visions. In the vision, she was at an inn with a knight's helm severed and bleeding on the signage. She was speaking to a crowd.
