**Mordesh** is a half-elven woman in Vallaki believed to be inciting civil war following the [[Battle of Burning Sun]].

She was first seen in the downtime between [[Session 27]] and [[Session 28]], in one of [[Arabelle]]'s visions. In the vision, she was at an inn with a knight's helm severed and bleeding on the signage. She was speaking to a crowd.

She was featured prominently in the lore document *Witches' Reach*, where it was revealed she had been possessed by the [[Witches of Berez]].
