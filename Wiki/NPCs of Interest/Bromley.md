**Bromley** is [[Arabelle]]'s brother, living in [[Krezk]] with her and her family before her parents died.

Before the beginning of the campaign, he left for [[Berez]], and [[Arabelle]] has been trying to find him. She finally reunited with him in [[Session 35]].

Despite initially appearing to be a firm supporter of [[Berez]]'s structure, it was revealed by [[Gertruda]] in [[Session 37]] that he had previously tried to leave, and seemingly been ensorcelled into staying.
