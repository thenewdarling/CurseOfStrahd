**Stella Watcher** is the only daughter of [[Lady Watcher]]. She was arranged to be married as a child with [[Viktor]] before the two families became enemies.

Following a magical experiment gone wrong by [[Viktor]], her mind was switched with a cat. Her family, thinking her insane, locked her in her room.

In [[Strahd Session 11]], the party managed to break her body free from the [[Watcher Manor]] on the night of the masquerade ball, with the help of [[Sasha]].

He and [[Viktor]] currently run [[Vallaki]] technically following the [[Battle of Burning Sun]], though they are trying to establish democracy. By [[Strahd Session 27]], they are trying to rebuild the destroyed Vallakovich Manor as a town hall.
