A cat.

Daughter of [[Lady Watcher]], was arranged to be married as a child with [[Viktor]] before the two families became enemies. Her mind has been switched with a cat, and her family think her insane now. The party have agreed to help them return her to her body.

Update: they managed to return her to her rightful body after breaking her human body free from the [[Watcher Manor]] with the help of [[Stella]] on the night of the masquerade.
