**Rahadin** is the infamous wizard assistant to [[Strahd]].

The party did not meet him in person until [[Strahd Session 28]], but he first appeared in [[Arabelle]]'s vision in downtime before [[Strahd Session 19]], and we learned his name in [[Strahd Session 27]].

He is an elven man with long hair, and in his eyes [[Arabelle]] can hear the screams of his thousands of victims.
