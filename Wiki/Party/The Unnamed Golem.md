**The Golem** is a demon with artificer magics that possesses the [[Golem's Eye]]. They have no body of their own but can possess other objects and take on their attributes. 

Their name to the party is as of yet unconfirmed, as [[Tasha]], their original patron, used only insulting epithets to refer to them.

The golem does not seem to have a pronoun preference. 

The Golem is played by [[Bearded Liam]].
