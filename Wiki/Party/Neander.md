**Neander** is a demon with artificer magics that possesses the [[Golem's Eye]]. They have no body of their own but can possess other objects and take on their attributes. 

[[Tasha]], their original patron, used only insulting epithets to refer to them. The party settled on 'Neander' as a name, meaning *new man*.

Neander "'has been referred to as 'he', been referred to as 'she', and has been referred to as 'it'", but does not have a preference. The party default to (they/them).

Neander is played by [[Bearded Liam]].
