**Neander** is a demon with artificer magics that possesses the [[Golem's Eye]]. They have no body of their own but can possess other objects and take on their attributes. 

[[Tasha]], their original patron, used only insulting epithets to refer to them. The party settled on 'Neander' as a name, meaning *new man*.

Neander has not expressed their pronouns, and so far the party have defaulted to they/them.

Neander is played by [[Bearded Liam]].
