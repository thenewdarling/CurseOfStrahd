**Jeremiah Templeton** is a half-goblin wizard necromancer and ranger who is a member of the [[Heroes of Burning Sun]].

Leaving university to make something of himself, he has found himself in [[Barovia]] where he quickly succumbs to the bite of a zombie, and now lives in an undead state. The entire campaign will likely be his tragic backstory.

He is played by Bearded Liam.

Jeremiah uses (he/him) pronouns.
