### Background
----------
Jeremiah was born in the woods south of Temple Town where he lived with his goblin Mother. 
When his mother fell ill, they caught a carriage to Temple Town. His mother died on the way.
Upon arriving at Temple Town, He was taken in by Nold, the goblin Janitor of the Magic university.
Jeremiah grew up and slowly gained an interest in Magic, which was frowned upon by Nold.
Upon Nold's death when Jeremiah was 30, he took up the janitor role, pilfering pieces of magical equipment from the university so that he could pay for a correspondence course at the University of Life.
At 40, Jeremiah, worried that his magic practice was being discovered, took a carriage out of town, using his new name for the first time.

# Trivia
