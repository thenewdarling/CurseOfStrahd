**Jeremiah Templeton** is a half-goblin wizard necromancer and ranger who is a member of the [[Heroes of Burning Sun]].

Leaving university to make something of himself, he has found himself in [[Barovia]] where he quickly succumbs to the bite of a zombie, and now lives in an undead state. The entire campaign will likely be his tragic backstory.

He is played by Bearded Liam.

### Background

----------
We're almost there mother, hang on just a little longer
Jem, promise me you'll be good.
Of course I will, and you'll be there to keep me on the right track, won't you?
...
Won't you mum?
... 

----------
My mother needs to be buried Sister.
Do you have a family grave in this town?
No, we're.. well, she's from across the sea.
I'm sorry, temple town has reservations on all its graves, we cannot bury anyone else.
Please, she always talked of her love for the Thunder god, surely he would want her buried in his shadow?
Talos is no mere god of Thunder. If you knew that then you would know that the Storm Lord's shadow stretches everywhere. Good day boy, I must attend to my congregation.

----------
Well I can't have a stinkin corpse in my carriage another day!
Please, no-one will take her, can't you take us back?
Boy, it was black as a Goblin's arsehole when I picked you both up... no offence of course lad, I just mean-
You don't know where my home is...
All right, I can take you to the edge of town, but no markers mind, I'll be run out of town for an unlisenced burial

----------
Hey... hey... wake up boy, you're in my way.
Sorry sir, I must have fallen asleep. 
Ah no matter young lad, what leaves you sleeping on the street?
The Inn was locked for the night, I hoped I could get some breakfast if I waited. 
I'm sorry lad, but they won't just be giving out breakfast, and you don't appear to have a purse on you.
What? No, it can't be gone, it can't...
Stop worrying! you're a smart lad, see? WHat's that you've got hidden behind your splendid ear? Why it's two shining silver pieces.
I... I can't take these sir.
You're not taking them! They belong to you! Come in with me and I'll make sure you get extra rashers on your breakfast, I know the barman y'see.

----------
What did you get from him Nold? I saw a flick of your wrist when he pushed past but not what you took?
And what in the seven hells were you doing watching lad? I can't have the professors noticing you.
Well you didn't see me and You know I can't do magic, so they're never going to spot me either!
You're getting cocky, but you spot more than I do these days. I need you to take these books to the fence today. I've got a lot of cleaning to do and I'll be missed.
Should we really be stealing the books Nold? Isn't it well... wrong?
It's also wrong to expect a janitor to be at your call at all hours for barely a silver piece a week!
Two wrongs don't-
Lose the university more than a few copper pieces a year. Stop reading those fables of yours.
But don't the students lose money when you steal the books? they have to pay to replace them.
True, but only the ones who treat me as a servant won't notice me stealing. And if they can afford servants they can afford a few books. 
But-
Off with you! I'm being summoned to a clogged toilet on the 4th floor

----------
Nold?
Yes lad?
Why don't you leave?
What?
Why don't you leave and find a better job? You say you're never paid enough.
I've always wanted to lad, did I ever tell you how I once robbed the Adventurer's guild in [[Malazan]]?
Only several billion times.
Well, I lost my touch after a while, tried to rob this place, and I was caught. 
What? You said you were the best rogue this side of the wastes!
I am! I used magic though, they can track that here.
You never said you could do magic?
I can't anymore, his ring is soulbound to me now, stops me using magic and lets even the lowliest student summon me.
Oh, but I could use magic then?
Not while you're with me you're not!
But-
Eat your dinner!

----------
I saw that Jem, you stole from the barkeep
He wagered that gold fair and square!
If it was fair he would have won at least once, you can't pull that on people we have to see every day, much less the man who feeds us.
You said I had to practice or I'd never be a rogue Nold!
Well take this as a lesson I'm letting you learn the easy way.
I'm gonna be the best Rogue! People are going to tremble at the name Jem of Temple Town!
Here's another lesson Jem, Don't say "of" only nobles do that. That'll be the first sign you're lying. Just go with Templeton.

----------
Only 6 silver? it should have been seven?
He thought the quality wasn't good enough. Rabbit of negative euphoria today.
Eh?
Not a Happy bunny.
Where'd you learn words like that?
At the bar.
Ah right. Get to bed, that thee sore uss was under your pillow by the way, it can't be comfy.
Nold I-
Don't worry lad, at least it's not magic.

----------
You're old enough to leave now lad, go before there's any more reason to stay.
Nold, you're sick, I'm not leaving.
I'm not sick lad, I'm dying, and when I die the University will investigate and assume you killed me.
You're not dying Nold. Even if you were, students have seen me around and would just assume I was the new janitor.
Don't get locked into this life, leave, have a good life, be who you wanted to be, be good.
I can do that here, my life is good here.
...

----------
Umm, Janitor?
Oh, sorry, I was reading.
I didn't know the servants could read.
My mother taught me, why are you here young sir?
Ummm, A friend of mine... had an accident...
You should call the nurse
Not that kind of accident, he tried to clean up some... leavings with prestidigitation and... it grew
Lovely, and why did he try that? Was the toilet clogged?
No, he uh, read it in a book.
Well, "he" should read better books. Illiterate folk in this town know that author is an idiot. I'm on my way.

----------
Well you've got a bounce in your step today young master Jem!
"Young" is becoming more of an insult to you than a compliment of me these days!
Well you're the master of words to my young'uns, boy read me a story just last night, amazing what two days of teaching can do!
No one learns that fast, he just told you a story he heard from the sisters, did it have a lot of gods and smiting?
No gods I know of, lots of smiting though.
Well he's smart enough to change the names at least. Anyway, a jug of ale and four tankards please.
Got some friends joining?
No, I'm going to figure out how those students keep their drinks cold in the summer.
You wouldn't be taking classes at the university now?
Of course not! Just messing about to pass the time.

----------
Psst, come here.
I'll have my breakfast alone thanks
Oh, then I'll just stop fencing those books shall I?
For Gruumsh' sake don't say that in here! What do you want?
I heard, I know, that there's some fancy artifacts in the University. If you could get me even one, I would pay a pretty penny.
Those artifacts are magically protected, You don't want to know how much frogspawn needs cleaning up when a pair of randy students gets too close.
Right, so the stacks of books you leave me aren't?
No
Then why do I detect necromancy around them recently?
You can detect magic?
In a manner of speaking. Listen, I was worried when the goods nearly stopped flowing, but now it's better than ever. This is just the next step up won't you agree?
I'm no rogue, I don't steal for the glory I do it to make a living. And if you're not happy with that find someone else to get your artifacts.
Well then, guess that's me told. You couldn't maybe leave a few doors open though? I heard there's a drow travelling through in a few days. Good rogues them.
There's people travelling through soon?
Yeah, a caravan or two, what, you want to go with them?
I don't have enough to get me anywhere and you know it.
Maybe, but I could maybe sell an artif-
I'm not going to steal an-
No, keep your voice down, I just meant that you have Nold's stuff right... Well he had a ring he would never have sold...

----------
It's 3 Silver to [[Malazan]] my good sir, you'll be bunking with a few others mind.
I don't mind thank you. 
You'll get a good night's sleep mind, clouds are out, it'll be as black as a goblin's arsehole tonight!
Well, I'd know wouldn't I
Oh i meant, I mean-
Don't worry about it
Here, I think if you're bunking you should get a silver back mister...
Templeton, Jeremiah Templeton
