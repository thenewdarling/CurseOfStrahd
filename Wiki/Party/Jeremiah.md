**Jeremiah Templeton** was a half-goblin wizard necromancer and ranger who was a member of the [[Heroes of Burning Sun]].

Leaving university to make something of himself, he found himself in [[Barovia]] where he quickly succumbed to the bite of a zombie, becoming undead.

After being separated from the party at the end of [[Session 30]], he was killed by [[Rahadin]], and his head and spine were thrown at the party's feet.

Before his death, he was played by [[Bearded Liam]], and used (he/him) pronouns.

### Background

Jeremiah was born in the woods south of [[Temple Town]] where he lived with his goblin Mother. 
When his mother fell ill, they caught a carriage to [[Temple Town]]. His mother died on the way.
Upon arriving, he was taken in by [[Nold]].

Jeremiah grew up and slowly gained an interest in Magic, which was frowned upon by [[Nold]].
Upon [[Nold]]'s death when Jeremiah was 30, he took up the janitor role, pilfering pieces of magical equipment from the university so that he could pay for a correspondence course at the [[University of Life]].

At 40, Jeremiah, worried that his magic practice was being discovered, took a carriage out of town, using his new name for the first time.

# Trivia

- Jeremiah never met another half-goblin.
