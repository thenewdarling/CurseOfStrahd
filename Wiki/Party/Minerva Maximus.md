*“You’re so sneaky, not even a hum. You’re just a bird.”* -- the Dungeon Master

**Minerva Maximus** was an Aarakocra Rogue whose avian features were reminiscent of a hummingbird, featuring a long beak which she would use as her rapier. She travelled with [[Prince Rupert]] at some point before his arrival in [[Barovia]].

She is played by [[Bearded Liam]].
