*“Alright, bambino. Here’s the deal. You’re gonna tell us where your friend is, and you might live to see another sunrise.”* -- Juniper

**Juniper Vandross** was a satyr Swords Bard who travelled with [[Prince Rupert]] at some point before his arrival in Barovia.

He is played by [[Luke]].

Juniper uses (he/him) pronouns.

He had fluffy hair and a ruffled poet shirt, wearing a long multi-coloured coat, with nothing over his goat legs. He smoked a long pipe he was quite fond of.
