**Gem** is a homunculus created by [[Neander]] using the [[Demon's Heart]], shortly after learning more about the nature of living creatures. He was born at the end of [[Strahd Session 36]] in [[Berez]]. He was named after the gem in the centre of his core.

(Not to be confused with the given name of [[Jeremiah]], with whom Gem bears no relation.)
