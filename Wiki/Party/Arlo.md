**Arlo de León** is a human fighter who is a member of the [[Heroes of Burning Sun]].

Charismatic and easy-going, Arlo is a gravedigger and mortician. His main goal is to leave [[Barovia]] and return to his loving wife, the unparalleled necromancer [[Allessandra]].

He is played by Kate.

Arlo uses (he/they) pronouns.

#### Background

Arlo's fascination with the morbid began at a very young age, at his family residence in the city of [[Thornworpe]]. With an embalmer father and a butcher mother, death was ever-present in the De Leon household. Some of Arlo's fondest memories are of watching his father meticulously prepare a body for burial, and of his mother demonstrating the best way to butcher a pig.
 
At age 17, a plague that spread through the lower parts of the city took the life of both his parents, and Arlo went to live with a friend of his father's, graves-keeper Barron. Barron gave Arlo a job in the cemetery, and there Arlo remained as a gravedigger for 10 years.
 
At age 27, Arlo started to notice odd occurrences at the cemetery - graves being disturbed, body parts going missing. After many unsuccessful investigations and stakeouts, he finally found the source of the disturbances. And that's how he met [[Allessandra]] - the love of his life. 
 
[[Allessandra]] is an elven necromancer and scientist, with a morbid hobby of creating frankenstein monsters from various body parts, who she keeps in service to her in her stately manor (until they rot and collapse again, and she has to replace them). Arlo fell in love with her at first sight. He began to woo her by bringing her the freshest body parts he could. It was a wonderfully horrid whirlwind romance.
 
Now 38 and happily married to [[Allessandra]] (aged 247), Arlo takes regular trips away from their manor to find exotic parts for his wife's experiments. He is on one such trip when he is caught by an unnatural fog, and finds himself in an unfamiliar place. He has one goal: get back to his wife.
