**Arabelle** is a human warlock with the ability to see the future. She ran a farm outside of [[Krezk]] before joining the [[Heroes of Burning Sun]] on their quest after their destiny was forever altered. 

She is played by [[Taanit]].

Arabelle uses (she/her) pronouns.

Her mother and father were called [[Agathys]] and [[Luvash]], and her brother [[Bromley]] had left for [[Berez]] after their death. Her main adventuring goal was to reunite with him, meeting him again in [[Strahd Session 35]].

~~A young woman who runs a farm just out of [[Krezk]], or owns horses at least. She is perceptive and clever, and a good shot. She offered the party another tarot reading, and her cards burst into flames under the POWER OF DESTINY [#TAASNEAK]~~
