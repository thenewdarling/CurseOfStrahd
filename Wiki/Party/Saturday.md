**Saturday** was a variant human Divination Wizard who travelled with [[Valdrid]] during the [[Bearded Liam's Megadungeon]] campaign. A scatterbrain and a nerd, her spellbook was a higglety-pigglety mess of tarot cards and her trading cards.

Saturday uses (she/her) pronouns. She is played by Luke.
