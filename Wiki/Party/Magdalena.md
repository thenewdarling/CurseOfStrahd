*"By Cerberus, woman, you have a grip like a vice..." -- [[Asmodeus]]*

**Magdalena Viviana Fortescue Schiaparelli de Luna** is a variant human Cleric of [[Asmodeus]] who is a member of the [[Heroes of Burning Sun]].

She is a vampire hunter who befell the curse herself over two hundred years ago, and in life was the last Queen of [[Iliadvar]] -- a country which no longer exists in the modern world.

She is played by [[Luke]].

[[Magda]] uses (she/her) pronouns.

#### Background

_[[Asmodeus]], who rules hell with an iron fist._ 

Magdalena de Luna has made a Faustian bargain. She will carry [[Asmodeus]]' torch, and in return he will give her the power to breathe unholy hellfire on the undead.

Except now she has succumbed to that curse she sought to scourge. The vampire hunter has become a vampire herself.

Immortal, incurable, she will do what she has always done. She will use this power to wipe the land clean. She will be the last vampire, and she will die knowing her good work is complete.

_“They say if you kill a vampire, every person that vampire has turned will also die. And I’ve heard that [[Strahd]] von Zarovich was the first vampire.”_

[[Magda]] is 270 years old.

Over 200 years ago, [[Magda]] was the heir to the throne of a country called [[Iliadvar]], a country which no longer exists.

A wave of undead spread through the kingdom, an illness known as the Plague. Over the course of ten years, the entire country fell to anarchy and collapsed. The countries around it basically waited for it to burn itself out, and once it was barren they divided it amongst themselves.

This experience caused [[Magda]] to make a faustian pact with [[Asmodeus]] to give her the strength to destroy all undead. [[Asmodeus]], a Lawful creature who hates chaos, accepted and granted her a demonic Cleric domain.

Around 20 years into this pact, she was bitten by a vampire, and turned. Her cleric powers and willpower have stopped her thus far from succumbing to being a mindless ghoul, but she is always teetering on the line.

#### Trivia

-   Her ex-husband became a werewolf. His name hasn't been spoken in the campaign, but his brother is revealed to be called [[Roderigo]].
-   She keeps a diary and has for many years (each one is this thick insert-journal tome lasting like ten years)
-   Her many names are because of her lineage -- I purposely spread the influences across Europe because in that kind of background your name is also kind of your title, and so represents how all these families were intermarried and the like.
-   She names all of her weapons.
-   Magda has a birthday on Day 25 after the party arrive in Barovia. Presumably her next birthday will be on Day 390.
