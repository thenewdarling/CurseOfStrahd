**Mango** was a member of the [[Explorer's Guild]] in [[Malazan]]. He was mauled to death by a skeletal dragon. (Sorry.)

His spirit was later found by [[Julian]] in another plane of existence, who didn't realise what it was and traded it to a vendor.

Mango uses (he/him) pronouns. He was played by [[Bearded Liam]].
