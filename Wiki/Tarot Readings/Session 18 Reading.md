## [[Arabelle]]'s Reading

**The WIZARD**: Where once was knowledge now there is death.

**The THIEF**: A sword that was taken, shall be stolen once more.

**The ANARCHIST**: An ancient force is biding its time.

**The HORSEMAN**: A soul returned, and now she is lost.

**The TEMPTER**: Fear not only the Devil, but the Dark itself.
