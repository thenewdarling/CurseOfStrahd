## [[Madame Eva]]'s Tarot Reading

_This card tells of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy._

**The WIZARD** - Look for a wizard's tower on a lake. Let the wizard's name and servant guide you to that which you seek.

_This is a card of power and strength. It tells of a weapon of vengeance: a sword of sunlight._

**The THIEF** - What you seek lies at the crossroads of life and death, among the buried dead.

_This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope._

**The ANARCHIST** - I see walls of bones, a chandelier of bones, and a table of bones-all that remains of enemies long forgotten.

_This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly in the battle against darkness._

**The MISTS** - A [[Vistani]] wanders this land alone, searching for her mentor. She does not stay in one place for long.

_Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality. This card will lead you to him…_

**The DARKLORD** - He lurks in the depths of darkness, in the one place to which he must return.
