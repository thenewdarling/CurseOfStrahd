*_Before there was time, there were Gods. Not the deities of today, but ancient beings that shaped reality. Now there are only reflections. Baroviaâ€™s Morning Lord is one image of many, each reflecting some aspect of the true God of Light. This is known by some, but few truly understand._* -- [[TenderstDM]]

_"I am myself but a partial image of the true Prince of Demons. The creature [[Vampyr]] is another. It controls this pitiful demi-plane and is the keeper of the so-called Devil."_ -- [[Asmodeus]]

___

Current lore states that **the Pantheon** within the [[Shared World]] are multiple prismatic reflections of an older group of Gods. 

What happened to those Gods, and the process by which they became the multiple fragmented deities we have now -- be it cataclysm or simply time -- is currently lost to history.
