**Vladimir's Fire** is a magical item with the following attributes.

When you are reduced to 0 Hit Points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. If an attacking creature reduced you to 0 Hit Points, they take 4d8 fire damage. You can use this feature once per Long Rest.

It was gifted by [[Argynvost]] to [[Arlo]] in [[Strahd Session 33]], who wasn't there to receive it and so the party took it to give to him.
