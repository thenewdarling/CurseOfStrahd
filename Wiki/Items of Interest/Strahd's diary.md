**Strahd's diary** is an originally mundane object, a diary from before [[Barovia]]'s descent into the mists, when [[Strahd]] was human. Attuning to it binds the reader to Strahd, and therefore to the land of [[Barovia]]. 

According to [[Van Richten]], who gives them it in [[Session 31]], it is only by doing this one can survive entering the [[Amber Temple]] and breaking the spell that keeps it untethered from the [[Prime Material Plane]] in the mists.
