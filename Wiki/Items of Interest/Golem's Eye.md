The **Golem's Eye** is a rare artefact containing a demonic entity. One featured in the [[Curse of Strahd campaign]], where it was owned by [[Shay]] the Kenku before being traded to the party.

In [[Session 31]] it was revealed by [[Van Richten]] that it belonged to [[Sasha]] originally, at which point he animates it into **[[Neander]]**.

#### Magic Item Information

*It is thought that sorcerers once knew how to imprison spiritual beings such that they would serve their needs; cloaks that would allow their wearer to step into the ethereal, gauntlets that would lend great strength, orbs that would give agency to the otherwise inanimate. The eye hums with the energy of that trapped within it – attuning to the orb imposes one’s will upon the demon. Once each day, the user may bind the eye with an object, any non-magical substance will give way to the orb and best gather itself into a suitable form.*

The Golem's Eye has the following magical effects:

Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Touch 
Target: Nonmagical object 
Components: V S 
Duration: Up to 1 minute 
“Choose a nonmagical object, Medium to Huge in size, that is not being worn or carried. The target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends, or until it is reduced to 0 hit points. As a bonus action, you can mentally command the creature you made with this spell. You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete."

If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, the Golem’s speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the Golem drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original form.”
