The **Holy Symbol of Ravenkind** is a magical artefact that [[Strahd]] had previously given to another adventuring party he had asked to do his bidding. Apparently, when they failed, it had taken him some time and effort to retrieve it. He gave it to the party in [[Session 30]] when he requested they retrieve the [[Skull of Argynvost]].

When not covered, lesser vampires such as [[Sasha]] and [[Magda]] see only a blinding light. 

[[Arlo]] used it to destroy [[Sasha]] when she attacked the party in [[Session 30]].
