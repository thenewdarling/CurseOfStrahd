*"We're going to do terrible things together..."*
*-- [[Magdalena]]*


**Traitor** was the name given by [[Magdalena]] to a +2 magic sword found within [[Tasha]]'s Tower in [[Barovia]].

It has a basket hilt that resembles a spider, and has the following magical ability:
*Twice per day (as per a Druid's Wildshape): Pricking your finger on the hilt of the rapier transforms you into a spider. At will you may return to human form.*
