Crafted by [[Dargos]] and [[Jakob]] Weerdo, the armour [[Arlo]] received in [[Strahd Session 27]] has the following effects:

Eminently stylish, this armour consists of a fitted metal chest piece that lies discreetly beneath a coat or jacket **(AC 14 + Dex modifier (max 2))**.
The design is such to enable multi-weapon fighting, providing freedom of movement along with easy access to weapons through various buckles and belts: 
• You gain a +1 bonus to AC whilst you are wielding a separate melee weapon in each hand. 
• You can use two-weapon fighting even when the one-handed melee weapons you are wielding aren’t light.
• You can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.
