The **Coin of Portable Hole** was a magic item given to [[Jeremiah]] Templeton by a raven that was later revealed to be [[Urwin]] Martikov.

It was forged in [[Wiki/Places of Interest/Argynvostholt]], and is inscribed with the phrase: *"We are the Light, that watches over the Dark."*

It has the ability to transform into a traditional magical portable hole.

#### Other Details
- It canonically makes a flash of light when [[Jeremiah]] activates it, making it unsuitable for stealth missions.
