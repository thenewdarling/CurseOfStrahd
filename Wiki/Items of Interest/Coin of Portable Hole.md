The **Coin of Portable Hole** was a magic item given to [[Jeremiah]] Templeton by a raven that was later revealed to be [[Urwin]] Martikov. After [[Jeremiah]]'s separation from the party in [[Session 30]], a raven delivered it to [[Arabelle]].

It was forged in [[Argynvostholt]], and is inscribed with the phrase: *"We are the Light, that watches over the Dark."*

It has the ability to transform into a traditional magical portable hole.

In [[Session 33]], [[Argynvost]] asked [[Arabelle]], [[Neander]] and [[Ireena]] to store the Skull of [[Kala]] in it, to swap for the [[Skull of Argynvost]] in order to trick [[Strahd]].

#### Other Details
- It canonically makes a flash of light when [[Jeremiah]] activates it, making it unsuitable for stealth missions.
