**The Watcher's Eye** was a rare magical item with the following effects:

*Requires attunement.*
*Once per day, the eye can cast Clairvoyance for it's wearer.*
*Once per day, if the wearerâ€™s HP drops below 10, a blue glow emits from the amulet, effectively casting Armour of Agathys at second level.*

It was wielded by [[Arlo]] before being traded to [[Shay]] in [[Strahd Session 27]]. We then discovered that [[Strahd]] could watch us through it the entire time he was wearing it.
