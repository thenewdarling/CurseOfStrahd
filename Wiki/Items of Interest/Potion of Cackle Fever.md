**Cackle fever** is a disease whose primary symptom involves involuntary, uncontrollable laughing. This causes exhaustion over time, into death.

The disease itself can be inflicted by imbibing a potion, but it is highly contagious. Hearing the laughter of someone with cackle fever can cause a listener to contract the disease themselves. For this reason, a single contraction of the disease in a populated area can cause epidemics.

#### Antidote
An antidote to the effects was kit-bashed by [[Francis]] of [[Vallaki]]. It does not stop the resultant exhaustion, but it suppresses the laughter response which prevents the disease spreading further.

#### Other Details
- The [[Heroes of Burning Sun]] discovered a Potion of Cackle Fever in [[Mog]]'s effects. Not knowing what it was, they took it to [[Francis]]' Apothecarist to be identified, who confiscated it. It was then smashed by looters, who had to be quarantined within [[Francis]]' shop.
