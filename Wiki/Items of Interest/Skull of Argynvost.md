The **Skull of Argynvost** is a trophy which [[Strahd]] asked the party to retrieve in [[Session 30]]. It is currently in the hold of the [[Witches of Berez]]. 

Its importance, according to what [[Strahd]] told the party, is based in glory, pride, honour, or sentiment rather than needing it for any kind of power or magic. 

As with all the bones in the Hall of Bones in [[Castle Ravenloft]], it was the skull of an enemy he killed -- in this case, [[Argynvost]] of [[Argynvosthold]].
