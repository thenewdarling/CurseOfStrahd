The **Starfall Ring** is a magical item with the following attributes.

Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level.

The ring can also serve as a 300gp diamond spell component -- roll 1d4 after use; on a 1 or 2, the ring shatters.
