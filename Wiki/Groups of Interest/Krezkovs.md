The **Krezkovs** were the family in charge of [[Krezk]].

They were functionally immortal, having forced the [[Abbot]] into servitude draining the life force of innocents in order to keep them young.

The [[Vistani]] sell them [[Alanatis]] plants.

After [[Strahd]] was revealed to have killed the Abbot in [[Session 28]], the fate of the Krezkovs seemed unclear -- until the party met them in Strahd's basement, transmogrified into a single acidic slime creature.
