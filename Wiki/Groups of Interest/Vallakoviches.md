The **Vallakoviches** are one of the two main factions in [[Vallaki]].

Historically overseeing the wall on the outer edge of the city, they are where the city gets its name from.

The Vallakoviches and the [[Watchers]] have long-standing tension.  They do not stand for despair in the city, and quash any thoughts of leaving [[Barovia]] as they think there's no chance they'll ever escape.

Following the [[Battle of Burning Sun]], [[Viktor]] Vallakovich and [[Stella]] Watcher plan to join the two households into one.
