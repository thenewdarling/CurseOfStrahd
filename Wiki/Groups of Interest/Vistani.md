The **Vistani people** are a nomadic group who live in [[Barovia]].

They are the only ones [[Strahd]] will allow to leave, on short leave to retrieve supplies -- knowing they will always return with their families hostage.

They are resourceful, enterprising, and more well-natured than most of the others forced to live in the mists.

#### Other Details
- They sell the [[Alanatis]] flowers to the [[Krezkovs]].
