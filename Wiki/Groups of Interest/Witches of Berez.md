*'The witches never really build anything. They just cover up the ugliness of this world.'* 
- [[Jenny]] Greentooth

The **Witches of [[Berez]]** are a famous coven of witches which the party first heard hearsay of in [[Session 1]], and met after [[Strahd]] sent them there in [[Session 34]].

Their matriarch, [[Baba Lysaga]] has built their town into a false paradise using the [[Skull of Argynvost]], which the party had come to steal.

They function on a fascist philosophy of strength, under the guise of 'helping the weak'. Every individual living in [[Berez]] must pull their weight 'for the good of the group', and failure to arbitrarily kill those that [[Beatrix]] deems traitors is also considered a crime warranting the death penalty.
