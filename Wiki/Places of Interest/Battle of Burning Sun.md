The **Battle of Burning Sun** was the culmination of a civil war within [[Vallaki]]. It occured on Day 11 after the party entered [[Barovia]] -- the planned date of a self-named 'Festival of Burning Sun' which proved to be the backdrop. 

The [[Watchers]] unleashed an army of vampire spawn on the population, in an attempt to overthrow the [[Vallakoviches]] and become the only family of power, but were thwarted by the party.
