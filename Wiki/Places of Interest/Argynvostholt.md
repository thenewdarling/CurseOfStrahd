**Argynvostholt** is an area situated between [[Krezk]] and [[Vallaki]] to the south. It is one of the only two places in [[Barovia]] that [[Strahd]] cannot enter, the other being the [[Amber Temple]].

It was once watched over by the [[Silver Knights]], however after being defeated by [[Strahd]] they are undead ghostly husks of their former selves, unable to move on, wandering in a stupor, and slowly forgetting all of their memories.

## Other Details

- [[Jeremiah]] found a [[Coin of Portable Hole]] from there, inscribed "The light that watches over the darkness."
	- Once [[Arabelle]] showed this coin to [[Godfrey Gwilyn]] in [[Session 32]], it convinced him that the [[Heroes of Burning Sun]] could be the party to finally defeat [[Strahd]].
