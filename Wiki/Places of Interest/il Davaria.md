The borough of **il Davaria** is one of the smaller neighbourhoods within [[Malazan]]. People generally associate the name with "Davaria", a form of bread sold in the area.

Two hundred years ago it was known as the **Kingdom of [[Iliadvar]]**, but it fell to a zombie horde because none of their neighbours would step in. They then divided it up between them, and now it has fallen out of memory.

[[Magdalena]] de Luna was the final monarch on the throne before the country collapsed.
