The [[Amber Temple]] is a site of great importance in [[Barovia]], one of the two places that [[Strahd]] can never enter himself.

The party first heard about it in [[Tasha]]'s Tower in a book index in [[Strahd Session 23 24 25 LISBON]], before [[Van Richten]] told them its purpose in [[Strahd Session 31]].

It is the seat of the spell that binds [[Strahd]] to the land. It is where the [[Heroes of Burning Sun]] must go if they are going to break his immortal hold over [[Barovia]]. This will return [[Barovia]] to the [[Prime Material Plane]], freeing [[Strahd]] from the [[Dark Powers]]' prison, but only then will they be able to kill him for good.

The [[Amber Temple]] predates [[Barovia]]. The valley used to be the nexus of lots of different planes. Monks in the valley settled upon it, discovered the amber rock, and built the temple to trap wandering spirits.
