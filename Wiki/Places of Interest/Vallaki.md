*Vallaki at night*

Originally founded by the [[Vallakoviches]] and the [[Watchers]], it is the closest thing Barovia has to a metropolitan area, being protected from the monsters in the mists by its mighty wall.

The party first reached Vallaki in Session 5.

#### Other Details
- From the top of [[Yester Hill]] you can see Vallaki in the distance but through some cruel magic, it appears as it did before [[Barovia]] became [[Strahd]]'s prison.
