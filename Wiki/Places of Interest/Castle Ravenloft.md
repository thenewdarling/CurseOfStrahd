**Castle Ravenloft** is the home of [[Strahd]] von Zarovich, and the center of the demiplane of [[Barovia]].

It was constructed by [[Strahd]] after his conquest of [[Barovia]] in the [[Prime Material Plane]], and named after his mother [[Queen Ravenovia]]. However, she died on the travel to see it for the first time. Her body is entombed in the crypt beneath the castle.

#### Trivia
- Every church in [[Barovia]] is built so that Castle Ravenloft is never out of sight if you look through the windows.
