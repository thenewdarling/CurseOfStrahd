**Old Berez** is the town underneath the illusion or transmutation magic [[Baba Lysaga]] used to turn [[Berez]] into a paradise.

It is a grim shell of the former town, dilapidated and mostly uninhabited but for [[Jenny]] Greentooth. 

In certain places, in cracks under walls and the like, the veil between the two dimensions is thin enough to see through but seemingly cannot be passed through physically. [[Jenny]] appeared to have some means of transport between the two, and the party were sent there during the Initiation Ritual in [[Session 37]].
