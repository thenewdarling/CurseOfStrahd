**The Winery**, also known as **the Vineyard**, is famously the only place in [[Barovia]] capable of producing grapes in a region that has no direct sunlight. 

It is located between [[Krezk]] and [[Yester Hill]], which appears to be the source of the magic that keeps the grapes growing.

It is home to [[The Keepers of the Feather]].
