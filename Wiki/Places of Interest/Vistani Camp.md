The **Vistani camp** is a travelling camp that wanders [[Barovia]]. It is home to the [[Vistani]] people, who are the only ones who are able to leave the mists. 

[[Strahd]] allows them to temporarily leave into the outer world to retrieve supplies, but they know that their loved ones will suffer if they do not return.
