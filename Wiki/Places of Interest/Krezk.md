**Krezk** is the largest settlement in [[Barovia]] aside from [[Vallaki]], and lies to the west of the region. 

From its borders you can see the edge of [[Barovia]], where the mists go on into seeming infinity. It is the religious capital of the region, home to the famed [[Abbot]] of St. Markovia.

The party first arrived in Krezk at the end of [[Session 15]].
