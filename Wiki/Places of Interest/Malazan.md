**Malazan** is a world capital citystate of multiple cities within the [[Shared World]].


#### il Davaria

One of the smaller neighbourhoods within Malazan. Two hundred years ago it was known as the **Kingdom of Iliadvar** but it fell to a zombie horde because none of their neighbours would step in. They then divided it up between them, and now it has fallen out of memory.

People generally associate the name with "Davaria", a form of bread sold in the area.
