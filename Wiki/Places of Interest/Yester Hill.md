**Yester Hill** is a hill to the West on the outermost reaches of Barovia. From its summit you can see Vallaki in the distance, but through some cruel magic it appears as it did in the days before the mist.

It is famously the burial site of [[Nicholas]] following the death of [[Eliza Day]]. He was buried under the tree at the top of the hill, and she was laid to rest under the Rose Garden.
