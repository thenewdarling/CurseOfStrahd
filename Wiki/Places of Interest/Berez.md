*If you go down in the woods today, you're sure of a big surprise,* 
*If you go down in the woods today, don’t listen to their lies*
*Deep in the trees where nobody sees*
*They'll hide and seek and take what they please*
*Today's the day the witches are coming to get you...*
— [[Vallaki]] nursery rhyme
