**Phandalin** is a small mining settlement on the Sword Coast of Faerun, and serves as the setting of (among other campaigns), the [[Lost Mines of Phandelver (Prince Rupert)]].

Approximately 30 years before the [[Heroes of Burning Sun]] arrive in [[Barovia]], [[Prince Rupert]], [[Minerva]] and [[Juniper]] make their way here seeking adventure. At this time, the town is guarded by the corrupt [[Redbrands]], and orcs and goblins raid travellers passing through.
