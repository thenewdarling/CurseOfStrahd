*The mists once more are stirring... It's been longer than expected, are we ready to return to Barovia?*
-- the Dungeon Master


The **Valley of Barovia** was a region in the [[Shared World]], until it was banished into a misty demiplane to serve as the prison of its all-powerful ruler, [[Strahd]] von Zarovich. 

Entire generations have lived within the mists, and escape is thought of as nearly impossible.

It serves as the main setting of the **[[Curse of Strahd campaign]]**.
