*The mists once more are stirring... It's been longer than expected, are we ready to return to Barovia?*
-- [[Tenderstem]]


The **Valley of Barovia** was a region in the [[Prime Material Plane]], until it was banished into a misty demiplane to serve as the prison of its all-powerful ruler, [[Strahd]] von Zarovich. 

It serves as the main setting of the **[[Curse of Strahd campaign]]**.

## History

 _"I am sorry for where you find yourself. This is a sinister place, but it is also a land steeped in history."_ -- Mad Mary

Entire generations have lived within the mists, and escape is thought of as nearly impossible.

Time in Barovia seems to be decoupled from time in the [[Prime Material Plane]], coming into 'orbit' some times but in other times, thousands of years going past in Barovia while mere days pass by. [1]

The [[Vistani]] are the only people Strahd 'permits' to leave for supplies from outside, holding their families ransom to ensure they return.

# Religion

 _'There is something wrong with this place. Not only are we trapped with the Devil, but it appears we are abandoned by our Gods.'_ -- Mad Mary

 It appears that the religious teachings of the two main gods in Barovia -- the [[Morning Lord]] and [[Mother Night]], have been manipulated by Strahd in ways that keeps them from having a proper connection with divine magic. [1]

# Time

Time in Barovia runs faster or slower relative to the [[Prime Material Plane]] depending on how close they are - at the point where the [[Curse of Strahd campaign]] takes place, it runs around half time -- ie. a year in Barovia is two in the material plane.

Barovia was already separated many years before [[Iliadvar]] fell (250 years before the [[Curse of Strahd campaign]]), but the [[Watchers]] have kept tabs on the material plane through the [[Vistani]]. They once had close ties with many of the royal lines, [[Fiona]] still believed knowledge was power, even if she could only watch from afar.
