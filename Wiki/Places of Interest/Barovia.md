*The mists once more are stirring... It's been longer than expected, are we ready to return to Barovia?*
-- [[TenderstDM]]


The **Valley of Barovia** was a region in the [[Prime Material Plane]], until it was banished into a misty demiplane to serve as the prison of its all-powerful ruler, [[Strahd]] von Zarovich. 

It serves as the main setting of the **[[Curse of Strahd campaign]]**.

## History

 _"I am sorry for where you find yourself. This is a sinister place, but it is also a land steeped in history."_ -- Mad Mary

Entire generations have lived within the mists, and escape is thought of as nearly impossible.

Time in Barovia seems to be decoupled from time in the [[Prime Material Plane]], coming into 'orbit' some times but in other times, thousands of years going past in Barovia while mere days pass by. [1]

The [[Vistani]] are the only people Strahd 'permits' to leave for supplies from outside, holding their families ransom to ensure they return.

# Religion

 _'There is something wrong with this place. Not only are we trapped with the Devil, but it appears we are abandoned by our Gods.'_ -- Mad Mary

 It appears that the religious teachings of the two main gods in Barovia -- the [[Morning Lord]] and [[Mother Night]], have been manipulated by Strahd in ways that keeps them from having a proper connection with divine magic. [1]
