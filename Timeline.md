- The party split into twos to help the relief effort.
- Varian and Magda have a run-in with looters in Francis' Apothecary, which becomes ground zero for an outbreak of cackle fever. With quick action, they manage to prevent the spread, but despite the antidote stopping the spread, they will have a point of exhaustion for days to come.
- The party arrive back at the Blue Water, stock the bar with wine from the portable hole, have a drink, refresh themselves, and get a well-deserved night's sleep.

*The events of Magda side-story 'Here, in the Garden' happen now.*

## Day 12
*Session 14 continued*

- [[Father Lucian]] asks [[Jeremiah]] if he can contact the [[Abbot]] of [[Krezk]], and rekindle his faith. After the conversation with [[Strahd]], and losing the bones of [[Saint Andreal]], he has lost his faith that the [[Morning Lord]] is still watching over them.
- The party pay [[Dargos]] 500gp, and agree to stop by [[the winery]] to find out what the status with his children, who left with [[Danika]] Martikov when the fighting broke out.

- The party conclude their long rest day, unlocking their full 6th level abilities.

## Day 13
*Session 14 continued*

- The party rides out of Vallaki towards the Tower at Krezk.
- [[Varian]] notices they are being followed throughout the day. As night falls, and the Barovian mists begin to roll in, they suppose that whoever is following them will likely not be able to see them either, and they stop to rest for the evening.

## Day 14

- Just after midnight: [[Magda]] takes first watch, and when she hears snarling out in the fog, she sends her new familiar Eden to have a look.
- [[Varian]] has a nightmare of being chased by a hell hound, [[Rose]]'s captor. He awakes in a cold sweat.
- [[Magda]] rouses the party, as zombies and the hell hound draw close...

#### Downtime events before Session 15

- During the night watch before Magda hears the snarling in the fog, [[Magda]] and [[Jeremiah]] discuss his zombification.

### Session 15 begins

- The battle for [[Rose]]'s soul begins!! Zombies, the hellhound, and the three hags.
- [[Varian]] calls out "Mog is mine!" and fights back to back with [[Magda]] as the scrum starts to converge.
- [[Arlo]] finishes the first of the three [[hags]], a day we've been waiting for for seven months of real time. A flurry of blades, living laughing and loving.
- Magda goes down and after two failed death saves, Varian pours a health potion down her throat.
- Mog is all but dead, and she releases Rose in an attempt to barter. Varian slays the hag regardless while she is defenseless.
- A woman on a horse rides in -- the famous Vistani Wanderer, Ezmerelda. She tells us that we went past the Tower, hidden by magical means. She also tells us the famous vampire hunter Van Richten was Danton all along.
- We agree to travel with her through the night without rest.
- We reach the crossroads between the Tower and Krezk itself, and Jeremiah asks the party to go to Krezk instead, to seek out the Abbot to help him with his zombification.
- Ezmerelda goes to the Tower without us.
- After riding throughout the day, the party stop to rest overnight on the outskirts of Krezk.

## Day 15
*Session 15 continued*

- In the distance we can see the edge of the world of Barovia where the mists become impenetrably thick.
- We find a horse in the road with a broken leg, its rider crushed by its fall. The horse belongs to a young woman named Arabelle who lives on the local farm.
- The party lead their horses by foot up the thin hill to the abbey, and leave them with a stable hand for a few gold pieces, joining a queue to see the [[Abbot]].

#### Downtime before Session 16

- The party have a heart-to-heart on the walk.

### Session 16 begins

- As Jeremiah won't be able to get in, Magda stays with him outside the boundary.
- The guards make a small cut in Arlo and Varian's hands to prove they aren't infected, and allow them entry.
- Arlo and Varian meet Genril, an abbey worker who they hand 15gp over to in order to be allowed an audience with him. (This quickly proves to be a pointless gesture.)
- They meet Karloman, a monk who explains about the blinding initiation ritual all monks here must go through (including him, even though he wasn't accepted). They also learn that the Abbot doesn't leave the Abbey ever, and very rarely heals people.
- They also learn about the Krezkovs -- the Abbot seems to be in their pocket.
- Magda and Varian are asked by the stable keeper to retrieve scales from the bottom of a pond inside the Abbey, and gives them a key.
- Arlo and Varian meet the Vistani traders, and recognise them from the camp in the first week of their arrival. They come here to sell Alanatis flowers to the Krezkovs, which they retrieve on their trips to the outside world Strahd permits them.
- The group reconvenes outside the main gate and Jeremiah turns invisible so they can all get through the gate.
- To take advantage of his invisibility timer, Jeremiah does a reconnoiter for other entrances to the Abbey.

### Session 17 begins

- After checking the place out, Jeremiah uses the last of his invisibility so they can all sneak into the food court. The party attempt to hide him in a corner. They introduce him to Karloman, who is attempting to be friendly but is clearly terrified.
- [[Markug]] spots the extra person in our group, and is on his way over, when [[Magda]] interposes herself between them. When it's clear he's not going to leave her, she uses her new vampire Charm ability and enthralls him, leading him away.
- [[Varian]] questions him -- he doesn't know the guard shifts but his sister, [[Areti]], will.
- That night, they sneak into the Abbey.
- [[Jeremiah]] flies down into the pool to retrieve the scales on the bottom, not needing to breathe in his current state. It doesn't damage him, but he is immune to poison so we don't know much more.
- Jumping into the pool seemed to alert the orbs, which start to attack. 
- There is a statue to get inside which needs to be filled with water from the pool. After Magda drops into the pool, and discovers immediately that it is all holy water, she's soaked. Upon taking damage, uses Misty Escape to teleport to the woman, wringing her sleeves out and filling the statue's hands. They fill halfway, and this time it sticks.
- Arlo does the same, soaking his trousers. The statue starts to open, but it takes two turns, and the party is being pelted by the statues. Magda and Jeremiah both go down, entering some kind of Life Drain effect. But with the help of their teammates, they make it inside and regroup (just).

*The events of Magda side-story 'Tomorrow Never Knows' happen now.*

## Day 16

### Session 18 begins
- Crossing midnight from previous events: [[Varian]] scouts upstairs, hearing the Krezkovs imbibing some kind of smoke (likely the Alanatis plant we were told about), and some kind of torture happening to a half-elven woman.
- Looking for the Abbot, the party find a little square room with a man working on something in the corner. The Abbot.
- [[Varian]] sneaks up and tries to cover his mouth but the Abbot catches his hand and attempts to force a combat that the party attempts to deescalate, until a ghost appears to end the fighting -- Sergei.
- The party learn that the Abbot sacrifices people to give the Krezkovs immortal life.
- A Krezkov woman with a veil covering a more rotten face than even [[Jeremiah]] enters. The party hide, while a platform drops from the ceiling -- revealing the half-elven woman from before. The half-elf woman is drained of her essence, and the Krezkov lady is restored to youthful life.
- The party find out the Abbot also invented the zombie curse at [[Strahd]]'s behest. [[Yalom]] and [[Sergei]] have been trapped in this room for hundreds of years.
- They find out Sergei's backstory -- and learn the truth of Ireena.
- Jeremiah's hand falls off. The Abbot can't heal [[Jeremiah]]'s curse, but he can freeze it in his tracks. He sews [[Jeremiah]]'s hand back on, and gives him a black ooze which prevents the zombification from getting worse.
- In exchange, the party agree to retrieve the Sun Sword, which he was supposed to have destroyed.
- Sergei leads us out of the city through a secret tunnel -- we know the Charm effect will have worn off by now and so Markug will be after us.

- The party meet the spirit of Nicholas, the supposed killer of Eliza Day. He is the one who stole the Sun Sword, but denies killing Eliza Day. 
- He asks the party to destroy the tree and set him free, in exchange he'll tell us where the Sun Sword is. Magda agrees (a lie), and exorcises him with Turn Undead when he gives over the information.

#### Downtime before Session 21
*The events of Magda side-story 'The Horse is Not Enough' happen now.*
- Appending that story, Varian has a response offering Magda some comfort.

### Session 21 begins

### Session 22 begins

## Day 20

- Come evening, when her spell slots return, [[Magda]] attempts to contact [[Ezmerelda]], who appears to be in another dimension -- in total darkness, unable to escape after the events of [[Arabelle]]'s vision.
- She also uses Divination to ask [[Asmodeus]] where they might find the hilt of the sword, and is told a cryptic phrase about the Amber Temple.

## Day 21

- [[Arabelle]] joins the party as they head to the Tower.

## Day 22

- The Tower appears in ruins, until the party solves the anagram on the door. 'HARKS AT DEATH' = 'TASHA THE DARK'.
- Arlo duels a sentient suit of armour and Jerry does a dance to unlock a chest and get loot.
- Jeremiah and Arabelle befriend Danton's tiger who is now blinded and was left in the Tower after the events of Arabelle's vision.
- Leaving the Tower behind with no new information, they decide to head to Vallaki, in the hopes that maybe [[Viktor]] will have some information about portals that could lead them to saving [[Ezmerelda]].

*The events of Magda side-story 'Traitor' happen during the long rest at the end of this day.*

## Day 23
