## Day 12
*Session 14 continued*

- [[Father Lucian]] asks [[Jeremiah]] if he can contact the [[Abbot]] of [[Krezk]], and rekindle his faith. After the conversation with [[Strahd]], and losing the bones of [[Saint Andreal]], he has lost his faith that the [[Morning Lord]] is still watching over them.

## Day 13
*Session 14 continued*

- [[Varian]] calls out "[[Mog]] is mine!" and fights back to back with [[Magda]] as the scrum starts to converge.

- [[Magda]] goes down and after two failed death saves, [[Varian]] pours a health potion down her throat.
- [[Mog]] is all but dead, and she releases [[Rose]] in an attempt to barter. [[Varian]] slays the hag regardless while she is defenseless.
- A woman on a horse rides in -- the famous [[Vistani Wanderer]], [[Ezmerelda]]. She tells us that we went past the Tower, hidden by magical means. She also tells us the famous vampire hunter [[Van Richten]] was [[Danton]] all along.
- We agree to travel with her through the night without rest.
- We reach the crossroads between the Tower and [[Krezk]] itself, and [[Jeremiah]] asks the party to go to [[Krezk]] instead, to seek out the [[Abbot]] to help him with his zombification.

#### Downtime before Session 16

### Session 16 begins

- As [[Jeremiah]] won't be able to get in, [[Magda]] stays with him outside the boundary.
- The guards make a small cut in [[Arlo]] and [[Varian]]'s hands to prove they aren't infected, and allow them entry.
- [[Arlo]] and [[Varian]] meet Genril, an [[abbey]] worker who they hand 15gp over to in order to be allowed an audience with him. (This quickly proves to be a pointless gesture.)
- They meet [[Karloman]], a monk who explains about the blinding initiation ritual all monks here must go through (including him, even though he wasn't accepted). They also learn that the [[Abbot]] doesn't leave the [[Abbey]] ever, and very rarely heals people.
- They also learn about the [[Krezkovs]] -- the [[Abbot]] seems to be in their pocket.
- [[Magda]] and [[Varian]] are asked by the stable keeper to retrieve scales from the bottom of a pond inside the [[Abbey]], and gives them a key.
- [[Arlo]] and [[Varian]] meet the [[Vistani]] traders, and recognise them from the camp in the first week of their arrival. They come here to sell [[Alanatis]] flowers to the [[Krezkovs]], which they retrieve on their trips to the outside world [[Strahd]] permits them.
- The group reconvenes outside the main gate and [[Jeremiah]] turns invisible so they can all get through the gate.
- To take advantage of his invisibility timer, [[Jeremiah]] does a reconnoiter for other entrances to the [[Abbey]].

### Session 17 begins

- After checking the place out, [[Jeremiah]] uses the last of his invisibility so they can all sneak into the food court. The party attempt to hide him in a corner. They introduce him to [[Karloman]], who is attempting to be friendly but is clearly terrified.
- [[Markug]] spots the extra person in our group, and is on his way over, when [[Magda]] interposes herself between them. When it's clear he's not going to leave her, she uses her new vampire Charm ability and enthralls him, leading him away.
- [[Varian]] questions him -- he doesn't know the guard shifts but his sister, [[Areti]], will.
- That night, they sneak into the [[Abbey]].
- [[Jeremiah]] flies down into the pool to retrieve the scales on the bottom, not needing to breathe in his current state. It doesn't damage him, but he is immune to poison so we don't know much more.
- Jumping into the pool seemed to alert the orbs, which start to attack. 
- There is a statue to get inside which needs to be filled with water from the pool. After [[Magda]] drops into the pool, and discovers immediately that it is all holy water, she's soaked. Upon taking damage, uses Misty Escape to teleport to the woman, wringing her sleeves out and filling the statue's hands. They fill halfway, and this time it sticks.
- [[Arlo]] does the same, soaking his trousers. The statue starts to open, but it takes two turns, and the party is being pelted by the statues. [[Magda]] and [[Jeremiah]] both go down, entering some kind of Life Drain effect. But with the help of their teammates, they make it inside and regroup (just).

*The events of [[Magda]] lore document 'Tomorrow Never Knows' happen now.*

## Day 16

### Session 18 begins
- Crossing midnight from previous events: [[Varian]] scouts upstairs, hearing the [[Krezkovs]] imbibing some kind of smoke (likely the [[Alanatis]] plant we were told about), and some kind of torture happening to a half-elven woman.
- Looking for the [[Abbot]], the party find a little square room with a man working on something in the corner. The [[Abbot]].
- [[Varian]] sneaks up and tries to cover his mouth but the [[Abbot]] catches his hand and attempts to force a combat that the party attempts to deescalate, until a ghost appears to end the fighting -- [[Sergei]].
- The party learn that the [[Abbot]] sacrifices people to give the [[Krezkovs]] immortal life.
- A Krezkov woman with a veil covering a more rotten face than even [[Jeremiah]] enters. The party hide, while a platform drops from the ceiling -- revealing the half-elven woman from before. The half-elf woman is drained of her essence, and the Krezkov lady is restored to youthful life.
- The party find out the [[Abbot]] also invented the zombie curse at [[Strahd]]'s behest. [[Yalom]] and [[Sergei]] have been trapped in this room for hundreds of years.
- They find out [[Sergei]]'s backstory -- and learn the truth of [[Ireena]].
- [[Jeremiah]]'s hand falls off. The [[Abbot]] can't heal [[Jeremiah]]'s curse, but he can freeze it in his tracks. He sews [[Jeremiah]]'s hand back on, and gives him a black ooze which prevents the zombification from getting worse.
- In exchange, the party agree to retrieve the [[Sun Sword]], which he was supposed to have destroyed.
- [[Sergei]] leads us out of the city through a secret tunnel -- we know the Charm effect will have worn off by now and so [[Markug]] will be after us.

## Day 21

## Day 22
